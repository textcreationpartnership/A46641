            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Did not ſome of the Roman Emperours, upon the reading of the Apologies of the Chriſtians, as of <hi>Justin Martyr, Apollinaris, Mileto, Origen, Tertullian,</hi> and others, declare their innocency, and mitigat the rage of perſecution, that then prevailed againſt them?

            <p>As our adverſaries calumnies &amp; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproaches, with which they labour to render us odious to all, eſpecially, to your <hi>Lo.</hi> are unjuſt and malitious; (being partly their evil and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deductions from our principles and actions, and partly groſſe &amp; notorious lies; ſuch as the heathens charged on the primitive Chriſtians, who finding no juſt mater for their accuſations from their Profeſſion and behaviour, gave it out to the world, that they worshiped the Sun, an aſſes head, and uſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous copulation at their aſſemblies;) So it is the Teſtimony of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that as a brazen wal does sheild &amp; uphold our Spirits from ſinking, under thoſe burdens, with which they have aimed to keep us at under with your <hi>Lo.</hi> We know, there is no new or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
<pb facs="tcp:39286:5"/>thing happened unto us, but what hath been the common lot of eminent ſaints, yea of Chriſt Jeſus, our bleſſed Lord and Maſter; the ſervant is not gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater then the Maſter; if they dealt ſo with him, no mervail they deal ſo with us. So great is the Teſtimony &amp; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our conſciences, as to all the greivous things, they have and do charge upon us, that we have hitherto poſſeſſed our ſouls in patience, and not opened our juſt and true greivances (as we might and should have done) for fear of offending your <hi>Lo.</hi> But perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the Goſpel, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our cauſe, and the welfair of immortal ſouls are like to ſuffer thorow our too long ſilence, we have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to diſcloſe our thoughts, and to give, ſo far as we can, a ſatisfieing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the grounds of that faith and hope, for which we ſuffer. The God of Gods knowes, &amp; Iſrael shall know, we uſe this fredom and plainneſs of ſpeech towards your <hi>Lo.</hi> and all others, not from any contentious and ill affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:39286:5"/>humour; but from the ſenſe of the obligations laying on us, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the true intereſt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the hope of relief for theſe from your <hi>Lo.</hi> which we moſt humbly beg and exſpect, for the ſake of truth and righteouſneſs, that are now fallen in the ſtreets, and fled into Corners if on an impartial examination of what we have ſaid, in the defence of our cauſe, and of ourſelves for its ſake, againſt the reproachs of our enemies, it shall be found that it is not juſt, but iniquous, we ask no benefite from your <hi>Lo.</hi> cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and juſtice; let all ſeverity be uſed. But if the cauſe of our former and preſent ſufferings be righteous (in the confidence of which, we have been bold to give to your <hi>Lo.</hi> and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world this ſober enſueing account) we humbly entreat that protection and relief in its defence, which your power and ſtation in this Kingdome do enable and oblige your <hi>Lo.</hi> to.</p>
            <p>Wherefore caſting ourſelves at your <hi>Lo.</hi> feet. We doe, in the behalfe of
<pb facs="tcp:39286:6"/>pure Religion &amp; undefiled &amp; the ſouls of all concerned therein, beſeech your <hi>Lo. Firſt</hi> That our juſt &amp; well grounded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt <hi>Prelacy</hi> &amp; <hi>Eraſtianiſme,</hi> may be taken into conſideration &amp; laid to heart: for if they hold good, will not the future conſequences of theſe evils, to this land, your <hi>Lo.</hi> families, &amp; poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be dreadful, who thereby are laid pento the judgments, denunced in the the Word of God, againſt perjury and Covenant breaking? We doe not lay the ſtreſſe of our cauſe on the Covenants &amp; Oaths, taken by this nation, againſt the foreſaid evils or corruptions, as the primary and chief Argument (as will appear to all on the peruſal of our ſubſequent <hi>Apology;</hi>) but on their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Word of the holy and true God: for, we grant, Covenants and Oathes, that are obligatory and binde to an obſervance, ſuppone their matter to be antecedently juſt, and do bring their primary obligation from it; hence the things contained in, &amp; engaged to by Covenants and Oaths,
<pb facs="tcp:39286:6"/>muſt be proven and made out to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſare &amp; righteous from the Word of God, before their obligation can be admitted &amp; received; which we have laboured to doe, in this following diſcourſe. And if from it, our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Oaths doe appear to be juſt, are we not aſſured, that the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſins engaged againſt by ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine tyes, and relapſed into contrare to theſe engadgments, doe provoke our Holy and righteous God, to the inflicting of all thoſe plagues and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, threatened in the word againſt the violators of ſuch ſacred bonds? And if this be a truth; (as we hope none will deny) what can we then expect to our ſelves &amp; poſterity, if reformation &amp; repentance doe not prevent, but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſolation, according to every ones acceſſion to theſe evils; which, no doubt, are crying for vengeance on this declining Church? <hi>Next,</hi> We pray your <hi>Lo.</hi> to conſider, that we build our concluſions on no other foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then our worthy reformers in this
<pb facs="tcp:39286:7"/>Church and others, laid downe in their arguments and debates againſt <hi>popery;</hi> which for its want of, and oppoſition to the holy Scriptures, they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for an Antichriſtian defection from the doctrines of Chriſt. We hold to the ſufficiency and perfection of the holy Scriptures, reſolving, thorow the Grace of God, to admit of no other rule of faith and obedience, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our God, but theſe: what they condemne, we muſt renunce; &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doctrins or practiſes, in the houſe of our God, want their authority and approbation, we cannot, yea dar not admit? The experience of the Church in preceding ages shews, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifs, the opening of this door, hath brought in upon her, to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt uter ruine of all her concerns.</p>
            <p>The preſent grouth of <hi>popery,</hi> and the quick advance it makes among all degrees of Profeſſors, in this and our nighbouring Churches, ſayes to all, &amp;, we ſuppoſe, to your <hi>Lo.</hi> that the faſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; preſervation of the proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:39286:7"/>Religion, does, in all pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, require, that its real and ſincere friends should be encouraged, and not thus perſecuted with violence; which no doubt, tends ſo to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening of the Proteſtant intereſt &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that in one of <hi>Queen Elizabeths Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> it was judged a ſufficient reaſon, not only to reſtraine the rigide preſſing of conformity, but likewiſe to encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge all Non-conformiſts, who, in thoſe times, were looked upon as ſtout an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts to popery, and ſuch as might be employed, entruſted and made uſe of in oppoſition to it.

And however we are repreſented to your <hi>Lo.</hi> as unfriends to Religion, and the intereſts of State (as if they muſt ruine if we ſtand) yet the experience of paſt and preſent times, beſide our publick confeſſions, doth ſufficiently witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, how malitious our adverſaries are in this unjuſt calumny? We are no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators, nor pleaders for innovation in Church or State; but do hold, adhere to, and reſolve, through the grace of God, to maintaine the reformed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, againſt all ſorts of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as it is contained in the holy Scriptures, ſummed up, and breifly comprehended in the Confeſſions of faith of the reformed Churchs; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Confeſſion of faith, Larger &amp; shorter Catachiſmes of this Church, in oppoſition to all <hi>Popish, Arminian, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian,</hi> and <hi>Sectarian</hi> errors and innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We hold for our maine &amp; root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:39286:8"/>principle, the holy Scriptures to be the Word of God, the abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and only rule of faith and maners; not needing any ſupplement of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical tradition: yet we do not deny Antiquity its due reſpect, uſe &amp; reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: and although we maintaine, that every Chriſtian, of what rank &amp; degree ſoever, ought to ſtudy, &amp; be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the Scriptures; yet we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the neceſſity and great uſe of a Goſpel ſtanding Miniſtry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the directive authority of the Church, not with an implicit faith, but with the judgment of diſcretion. We hold the teaching of the Spirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſare to the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt; but abſolutly deny, that the Spirit bringeth new revelations in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of doctrines, worship &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but only that he opens the eyes, and enlightens the underſtanding, that we may perceive and rightly take up, what is of old revealed in the word by the ſame Spirit. We rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, having no confidence in the flesh,
<pb facs="tcp:39286:9"/>or in a legal righteouſnes; deſireing to be found in him, who of God, is made unto us wiſdom, righteouſnes, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and redemption; yet we conſtantly affirme, good works of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards God, of equity and charity towards men, to be neceſſare, both <hi>neceſſitate precepti &amp; medii:</hi> our Miniſters preſſe on themſelves &amp; hearers, the neceſſity of Regeneration, as the ſolid fundation of good works; &amp; the ſevere, ſtrict exerciſe not of a popish out ſide formal, but of a ſpiritual, real morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſelf denial. We extol all ordinances of divine appointment; but reject all humane inventions, eſpecially religious and ſignificant not inſtitute ceremonies in the worship of God.</p>
            <p>It ought to have no little weight with your <hi>Lo.</hi> that by uſing of ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the moſt ſober, judicious, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally religious and induſtrious part of the ſubjects, and conſequently the moſt uſeful and ſtedfaſt to his Maj true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and honour, are expoſed to dayly vexation and trouble, to the great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb facs="tcp:39286:9"/>and prejudice of this Nation and Kingdom. We ſuppoſe that, upon an impartial view, it will be found, that the choice and better part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is diſſatisfied with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, now introduced into this Church, and conſequently obnoxious to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the lawes, enacted againſt non-conformiſts: and of what dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence this may prove to Church and State, we leave to your <hi>Lo.</hi> moſt ſerious conſideration. We know, the certaine iſſue of all maters, is known to God only; but if we shall take our meaſures, in conjecturing at future events, from the working of preſent cauſes, there is all rational ground to fear, that there are diſmal and heavy times coming on this nation; which, by taking and fallowing of right wayes, in the preſent juncture of affaires, your <hi>Lo.</hi> may prevent; and if not done, will, no doubt, afford mater of bitter ſorrow, &amp; repentance to your <hi>Lo</hi> or children after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. It is &amp; shall be our hearty prayer to God, that your <hi>Lo.</hi> may have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="tcp:39286:10"/>of wiſdome, and of the fear of the Lord, poured out upon you, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the evils, that are haſtening towards us, and in time to hide yourſelves, this Church &amp; Kingdom from them.</p>
            <p>Is it not apparent to all, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience does not act, nor lead our anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts? Do not their opinions about Prelacy; their Profeſſion of all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to comply with the contrare, if on foot; their frequent changes into the intereſts and formes of all preceeding times, how contrare ſoever to their once profeſſed and ſworn principles (while true Presbyterians remained conſtant and immoveable, thorow the times that went over their heads;) their covetous and licentious lives, diſcover their want of conſcience in the courſes, they now ſo furiouſly run? Let not your <hi>Lo</hi> think, that it is his <hi>Maj.</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, (as they pretend) or any true conſciencious regaird to theſe, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves them to ſuch obſeqiuous compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the preſent lawes? Let the out ward intereſts of this world be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb facs="tcp:39286:10"/>from their way; and it shall ſoon appear, how void they are of true zeal for his Maj. and his lawes, as is evident beyond all denial, from their carriage &amp; behaviour, in paſt &amp; preſent times. As we have no external benefite to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to engage us againſt conformity to the preſent lawes about Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſo we are to look, from our principles, and practiſes conforme thereto, no leſſe then the ruine of our ſelves &amp; families in this world: if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of duety towards God &amp; this Church, according to the word, did not determine and move us, of all men we were the moſt foolish and miſerable; but ſeeing our hearts, in the conſideration of the juſtice of our cauſe, &amp; of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our intentions, in acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to it, does not condemne us; we have this confidence towards God, that as we are acquit &amp; shall be juſtified before him; ſo shall we be recompenced and rewarded, to the aboundant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of all outward loſes; even for theſe things, for which we are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:39286:11"/>of men; ſo that that which is eſteemed our folly, ſin and miſery, is and shall be reputed our righteouſneſs, wiſdom and glory.</p>
            <p>Albeit we have not the external advantages of power, riches and wordly policy, but the contrare to contend with, and endure; yet, ſeing the Word of God in our hands, doeth proſper and prevail to the gaining of immortal ſouls, the reſtraining of impiety, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of the ſavour of the true knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, in all places where it comes, notwithſtanding of the oppoſition made unto us in this work; it will, on many accounts, be your <hi>Lo.</hi> wiſdome, not to ſtand in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory tearmes thereto, leaſt your <hi>Lo.</hi> be found to fight againſt God in the perſons of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and people; for, we are aſſured, that this work and cauſe is of God, partly for its confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his holy word; &amp; partly for its undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruit and ſucceſſe, in converting &amp; ſaving of ſouls from ſin, preſerving and maintaining of its ſelf, againſt the oppoſition it meets with on all hands; which we take for a ſigne of its being of God, as the Chriſtians did of old in their debates for the Chriſtian Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its adverſaries, which under great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition grew and prevailed exceedingly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſtript of all the outward advantages of worldly power and policy. If this cauſe be of God, and approven by him, as we nothing
<pb facs="tcp:39286:11"/>doubt, it will not be in the power of the might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to crush it. Men may afflict and put us to great ſufferings (which to them will be a ſigne of perdition, but to us of ſalvation;) but while this Church continues Proteſtant, and hath God abiding in her, their contradiction will be in vaine, as is hitherto manifeſt. And a thowſand to one, but it reſolve in their own ruine here &amp; here after.</p>
            <p>The mater of difference betwixt us and our adverſaries, being in their owne confeſſion (a popular argument they much uſe with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) not foundamental, but indifferent, we humbly beg of your <hi>Lo,</hi> that for preventing of further confuſions in this Church, &amp; attaining of the true peace of the ſame, you will be pleaſed, to conſider, whether it be better and ſafer for this Church, that the Chiſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion be totally ruined among us, for ſatisfying of a few; or a thing indifferent, &amp; far removed from the vitals of Religion, be taken away, and not thus enforced by violence on ſo conſiderable a part of the ſubjects, who, for conſcience ſake, cannot receive, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereto? And knowing that a ſerious and impartial examination of this one queſtion, if diligently purſued, would quickly determine your <hi>Lo,</hi> to courſes quite oppoſite to theſe now proſecuted with ſo much heat againſt us; we intreat your <hi>Lo,</hi> not to give eare to theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
<pb facs="tcp:39286:12"/>and undue repreſentations of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe of affaires in this Church, made by our enemies, the <hi>Prelates,</hi> by which they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to inſtigat to all this unjuſt and unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable violence, that will Produce bitter and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable effects to this &amp; the ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, if not prevented in time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt noble &amp; honourable Lords,</hi> we cannot but take notice of that too common prejudice entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Presbyterian Government &amp; inſtilled with ſo much artifice by our oppoſits in the mind of many, on which, they have alas too much advantag, through the love of ſin, &amp; natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity at the wholſome ſeverity and power of the Chriſtian Religion, that is predominant in all unregenerat perſons; to wit, the ſtrictnes &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of Presbyterian Government in its exerciſe, againſt all ſorts of ſcandals, in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Profeſſours, the great as well as the meane; for we know, that while Presbytery was up and in vigour amongſt us, the zeal and faithfulneſs of Miniſters, in reprehending all ſorts of ſins, and exerciſing of diſcipline im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, conforme to the commands and ruls of the word, without exception of perſons, is that which hath cauſed all this diſlike of, and rigour againſt Presbytery; and conciliat that much reſpect to, and love for Prelacy, as to eject the one, &amp; bring in the other. We will not now enter on the debait, whether this ſtrictnes
<pb facs="tcp:39286:12"/>againſt ſin be the native product of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Government, when exerciſed conforme to its principles; or the contrare the genuine conſequence of Prelacy, that neceſſarly reſults from its conſtituent &amp; preſerving cauſes? Which were no great labour to make out. But leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, we humblie entreat your <hi>Lo.</hi> to have that patience towards us, as to ſuffer us to ſay. 1. In conformity to the principle of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion, it muſt be, in the confeſſion of all Chriſtians, mater of ſad regrait &amp; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that in places, where the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is owned, zealous faithfulneſs againſt ſoul deſtroying ſins, should be admited &amp; received, as a prejudice againſt Miniſters &amp; their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which should commend &amp; cry it up; yea that does endear it to all conſcientious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that rightly underſtand their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Muſt it not be a terrible length, this generation is gone, in declineing from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Religion; when that, which is its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency &amp; glory in the ſight of God &amp; good men, is become the occaſion &amp; mater of its diſlike &amp; reproach? Can there be a fuller evidence and diſcovery of the predomining &amp; prevailing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of naturs enmity, in Profeſſours, over the life of true godlineſs; and their being given up to the luſts &amp; ſinful inclinations of their owne hearts, that thus ſets them in oppoſition to the meanes, appointed for their delivery from the
<pb facs="tcp:39286:13"/>dominion &amp; power of damning ſins: whither are we gone, and what may we expect will be the hight of our defection, and the judgment of it, if Profeſſours put themſelves in ſuch a plaine &amp; open profeſſed contradiction to their Chriſtian Profeſſion? 2. Let not your <hi>Lo.</hi> think, we ſay this with an intention to juſtify any failing, in this mater, commited by any of our perſwaſion, that shall be made appear to be ſuch from the Word of God, &amp; our Profeſſed principles. And although we cannot condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne all the inſtances, that are now diſapproved by our antagoniſts; yet we grant, there were conſiderable eſcapes, in preaching &amp; exerciſe of diſcipline, which were the effects of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; paſſion in ſome, and of wordly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations &amp; deſignes in others of corrupt minds; who to raiſe themſelves in this world, and for that end, to gaine the favour of perſons of leading influence &amp; power, keept no meaſure, but rune to ſtrang hights of zeal againſt ſome ſins, while they connived at others; but ſeing by their compliances with the cryed-up cauſe of theſe times, they do now declare to all the world that they vvere never of us; how unjuſtly are their wicked follies imputed to our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vvay. But for all the inſtances given in againſt us, and the hideous cry raiſed after them, yet vve muſt ſay, the greateſt and moſt common failing among Miniſters, vvas in the
<pb facs="tcp:39286:13"/>defect, in that the moſt vvere not ſo diligent, faithful &amp; impartial, in the application of the vvord to the ſins of the times, perſonal rebukes &amp; cenſures, as they should have been; as (alas) vvas too viſible &amp; obſerved by many; for vvhich novv they bear their rebuke, in that many of thoſe are now become their cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, to whom they were ſinfully ſparing &amp; indulgent. Moreover, let it be granted, that many of theſe inſtances were in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe unjuſtifiable; yet if the conſtitution and principles of Presbyterian Government were not for, but againſt them, it cannot be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe: they muſt be the faults of the perſons, and not of the Government; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all Governments muſt be condemned, as guilty of all the mal-adminiſtrations, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Governours; which all acknowledg to be abſurd? But when any of the contrare mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall demonſtrat theſe to be the native pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our principles for doctrine and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they shall be conſidered, &amp; according to the conviction they give of the ſame, they shall be acknowledged. But will your <hi>Lo.</hi> be pleaſed, to conſider the ſad &amp; deplorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme our antagoniſts are run into, who medle not with any ſort of ſcandals, except a few and theſe in the meanner &amp; lower degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, over looking all in the more opulent and great; which hath encouraged wickedneſs to
<pb facs="tcp:39286:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>lift up its head, and to diffuſe its ſelf thorow all ranks without control, to the infecting of this Church with all kindes of ſcandals; which, no doubt, will reſolve either into the total ruine of the Proteſtant Religion, or els in ſad deſolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgments, on this land; and if it come this length (which we earneſtly beg of the Lord he would prevent, by pouring out of a Spirit of repentance and reformation on us) where will be our advantage by <hi>Prelacy,</hi> that is now ſo much extolled?</p>
            <p>Therefore not loving to trouble your <hi>Lo.</hi> any further, we shall adde but this humble and earneſt requeſt; that your Lo. would be pleaſed, to make ſome due and juſt repreſentation of the true State and low condition of this Church, unto his <hi>Maj.</hi> who (we hope) through your <hi>Lo.</hi> interceſſion, will, in his wiſdome and clemency finde out ſome juſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, for relieving of this Church of her oppreſſing evils, under which she groans; and undoing of theſe heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, that lye on us: for which we are your <hi>Lo.</hi> humble petitioners, and had been ſo alittle ſooner, if we had not been diſcouraged by lawes anent Church maters, that ſeems to us, to cloſe all door of acceſſe to his <hi>Maj.</hi> and your <hi>Lo.</hi> for repreſenting our juſt greivances this way. If we may not obtaine this reaſonable and juſt requeſt (as we ſuppoſe) there is not another refuge left us, but to referre our cauſe to the righteous tribunal of the juſt and almighty God, where your <hi>Lo.</hi> and we will ſtand on ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We referre ſuch as queſtion this to the arguments of both; and upon an impartial collation of the ſame, we nothing doubt, but it will be manifeſt. Doth not the much courted and endeavoured reconciliation with <hi>Rome</hi> by the prelatical party, in former and later times, with their conceſſions to them, for making way to this agreement, ſpeak this with full evidence? As their denying the Pope to be the Antichriſt; their granting a primacy to him over the Catholick Church; their purgeing the Romane Church of Idolatry and ſuperſtition; their aſſerting the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Papiſts and us, in doctrine, worship and government, not to be fundamental, nor on their part damnable, &amp;c.

We cannot for bear to declare our reſentments to the world, of the high indignities done to our Royal and great <hi>Maſter, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and his bleſſed word, the holy Scripture; in that.
1. The forme of the government of his houſe is aſſerted to be mutable, at the pleaſure of men, and made capable of any forme they pleaſe to aſſigne to the ſame. Was it ever heard in the world, that the forme of any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was taken from the Officers thereof, and not from the Supream head, in whom the Legiſlative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is lodged? All that ever treated of governments, and ſpoke to their different forms, did always found their forms on the head, and not on the Officers of it? Is not <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Supream</hi> and <hi>only Head of the Church,</hi> by divine appointment? Are not ordinare Paſtores or Presbyters found inſtitute in the word, with all the parts of their power, that we afterwards grant to them? &amp;c Will it not then neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the forme is of divine right, both in the head and officers; which is truely <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> and not alterable at the will of any?2. For making way to this, the ſufficiency and perfection of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, as to matters of obedience and practice in the Church, is denied, and thereby the fundation of the Proteſtant Religion is shaken.

For our arguments plead as much and as ſtrongly for their perfection, in the one, as in the other. But muſt it not be a deſperat cauſe that needs ſuch a prop to ſupport it?(13.) In the laſt place, We humbly offer the following particulars to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by all; nothing doubting that, when they are duely and ſeriouſly weighted, it will ſoone appear that our exceptions againſt Prelacy, are not light and groundleſs. As 1. There is no good to the Church and immortal ſouls attainable by Prelacy, that may not be win at without it. It is a ſure truth, that every ordinance of Divine inſtitution hath it's proper good to the Church, in order to which, as it's end, it was appointed by Chriſt, which is not eaſily reachable by other ordinances: As will appear to any on a particular condeſcenſion: for as there is nothing defective in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitutions; ſo there is nothing redundant and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. Now we deſire to know, what is that good to the Church and immortal ſouls, that cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without Prelacy? let our Antagoniſts give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. If they think that ordination and jurisdiction is the good that the Church hath by prelacy; we offer to prove from Scripture and antiquity (as hath been done before us without a reply, yea and granted by many of them) that Presbyters have the power of ordination and jurisdiction; and the truth is, it was never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned by any, but yeelded by all, till of late; for we have not only inſtances in Scripture and antiquity, for Presbyters exerciſing ordination and jurisdiction; but,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39286:23"/>the reaſon, that all gave for it, was, that the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conferred by ordination, conſiſting of the power of order and jurisdiction, as it's integral conſtituent parts, perſons ordained receive the power of both: If this be a truth, why may not the Church have theſe by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as much to her advantage and benefite, as by Prelats? But ſon e ſay, there can be no unity or peace in the Church without Prelacy. The contrare is evident from the Churches experience, in former &amp; later times; for as the Church was never more rent, and filled with contentions and ſchiſms, then under &amp; by Prelates, of which there are innumerable inſtances in hiſtory; ſo there hath been much flourishing, unity and peace, under Presbyters, in Churches that wanted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats; as is to be ſeen in the preſent caſe of the reformed Churches, and will be evident to any that is acquainted with and ſeen in the records of the Church: what unity &amp; peace hath the Churches of <hi>Britan</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> beyond other reformed Churches. Yea is there not more of theſe among them, then is with us, at this day? But what ſayes unity and peace in the Church, if they have not truth and righteouſneſs for their cement and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which are ſeldome the attendents of Prelacy? But ſome place the good of Prelacy, in the overſight and inſpection, it takes of Miniſters and their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive flockes (of which they uſe to boaſt much;) But reaſon and experience do fully convince, and leave us beyond all Doubt, that this good, is as eaſily and better wine at, by Presbyters, in their aſſociated and presbyterated meetings, leſſer and greater, then by prelats: what can prelats do in this, that may not, and hath not been done by Presbyters, to the great benefite of the Church? as is manifeſt from the experience of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39286:23"/>this Church in preceeding times, and now not alittle confirmed by the contrare? Mworeover in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. S. 2. Act 1. it is given for one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, induceing to the bringing in and eſtablishing of prelacy among us, that it is moſt ſuitable to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. What good this does or can bring to the Church, we cannot divine: we wish it had been inſtanced in the foreſaid act: we know, the government of the Church, conſidered in its due latitude and extent, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the presbyterian principles, is truely and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monarchical; for is not Chriſt Jeſus the Supream and immediat head of the Church? and do not her officers act in her government in an immediat depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon and ſubordination to Him, as her King? So that if the Churches government being Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical be the good intended and meant, in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, it is as much attainable without prelacy, as by it; but we ſuppoſe, that this is not the good underſtood. <hi>Next,</hi> if by ſuteableneſſe to Monarchy, be meant, that kinde of Authority and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Church officers, in and over the Church, that is exerciſed by kings and Monarchs, and hath been aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by prelats, fince ever they appeared in the Church: this is expreſſy diſcharged and forbidden to Church officers in her government. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20, 25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22, 25. How much Emperours, Princes Kings and States have ſmarted by this dominion, is known in hiſtory? Some ſay, it is the ſuperiority and ſubordination of Church officers and judicatories, that is underſtood in this act; This may be had, and hath been attained in the Church, under presbyterian government, both as to officers and judicatories; the Paſtour is ſuperior both to Elders and Deacons &amp;c. the claſſicall presbytery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But the thing, we ſuppoſe, that is truly intended, is the bringing of the Church into a ſlavish dependence upon, and ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Magiſtrat; for which, we confeſſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy is every way fitted: how excellently did it ſerve the <hi>Pope,</hi> in eſtablishing of his Dominion, and in bringing and keeping of all in ſubjection to him? and albeit ſince the reformation, the prelats changed their head, in taking on the Magiſtrat in the roome of the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet they retaine their uſe, which exceedingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dears them to worldly Princes, that affect domination in the houſe of God: but (is shall be proven afterwards) this is contrare to the fredome of Chriſts kingdome, his abſolute ſupremacy and dominion over the ſame; and is inconſiſtent with Chriſtain princes their profeſſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection thereto; ſo that this is no good, but and evill deſtructive of the true concerns of the Church. 2. It is no ſmall diſcovery to us of the evil and corruption of prelacy, that it is much approven, allowed and cryed up by all perſones of profane, diſſolute and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched lives (except where it croſſes their wordly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts) and the reaſon of this is obvious to all, for as corrupt and wicked nature does diſlike all that is from God, as oppoſite to its wicked inclinations and wayes; ſo it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39286:24"/>loves, and is in much liking with all that is friendly to, and does encourage it in theſe. Is it not viſible, that the encouragement, which flagitious and wicked perſones find for their impieties, under the wings of prelacy, is the true reaſon and cauſe, for which it is ſo liked and cryed up by ſuch? In this it is contrare to Presbytery in its due and faithfull exerciſe, which hath been, and yet to this day, is hated for its impartialitie, ſtrickneſs and ſeveritie againſt all ſorts of ſcandal, in all ranks of perſons high and low: for this we appeal to the general ſenſe and obſervation of all in theſe landes: can we think that courſe to be of God, which for this reaſon is approven by the generality of the wicked? 3. Beſides this, does not the prelates oppoſition to the godly (whom in rationall charity all are bound to judge ſuch) in reproaching, oppreſſing &amp; perſecuting of them, to a ſtrange hight of ſeverity, who in profeſſion differ only from them in a point, that depends on the meer will and pleaſure of the Magiſtrat; we ſay, does not this declare, godlines to be their quarrel, and it to be inconſiſtent with, and contrare to their intereſts, which, we are ſure, cannot be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And whoever conſider the conſtitution of prelacy, the rules for its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe (to wit, the doctrines and opinions of prelats about Church-power and government) and the hight of Dominion, they lay clame to over the Church) will ſee, that of its ſelf, it muſt be an enemy to true god-lines, while it crys up its forme, and layes it ſelf out for advanceing of it, in oppoſition to its power. 4. It is received for a ſure truth, among all proteſtants, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39286:25"/>as the renewed nature of the Godly does hate, and is an enemy, to all that is contrare to, and deſtructive of true godlineſs; ſo it is the evidence and ſigne of the evil and ſinfulneſs of a cauſe, when it is disliked &amp; oppoſed by the generality of the truly ſober, judicious and humble Godly. If we shall apply this to prelacy, as it is eſtablished and exerciſed amongſt us at this day, have we not cauſe to ſuſpect its corruption, and to judge its deſcent not to be of God? ſeing it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally diſliked and hated by the truely Godly; which eminently appears in perſons converted from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſin, in which they lived before converſion; what ever likeing they had to prelacy, or hatred to presbytery, immediatly upon their converſion, they drink in an averſation from and hatred of prelacy, and love to the contrare? We know, this was <hi>objected</hi> by <hi>Independents</hi> againſt presbyterians, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy about Church government was hot betwixt them? But.
1. This objection was without any true cauſe, as <hi>Independents</hi> were forced, afterwards, and at this day, to confeſſe; they finding upon trial, that the Godly of the Presbyterian perſwaſion, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly more numerous, then the other.2. The difference betwixt them is very ſmall (which may be incident to perſones truly Godly, and conſiſtent with their grouth and exerciſe of godlineſs); and if there were a healing condeſcending temper, might be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and removed; their difference lying mainly, in the authoritative ſubordination of Church judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>If any ſay, we preach principles of ſeparation and rebellion. They, who aſſert this, are bound to make it out, of which we have heard nothing as yet, and should have been condeſcended on, and given for the ground of this act, and not the performance of theſe truly religious exerciſes, done by perſones authorized and enabled thereto, by the commands of God. We require of all engadged againſt us, to do us that piece of common juſtice, they owe to all men, in the like caſe, that they will inſtance in the doctrines we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and in the mater we pray, wherein our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are become the ſeminaries of ſeparation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, if they can: when this is done, we shall either give a ſatisfying anſwer to the charge, or els ſuccumb to this act.</p>
                  <p>It is like, ſome place this charge, in our diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the law. Then it comes from the law and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39286:30"/>the Law makers, and not from theſe meetings and the perſons that keep them; for antecedent to this law they were not in themſelves ſeminaries of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and rebellion, according to this objection: and if this be the effect of the law, it had been more ſafe to have forborne it, Whoſe work should be, rather to prevent and remove the ſeeds of rebellion, then thus to ſowe them But this law in its narrative ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons theſe meetings to be ſuch, antecedent to its enacting; but gives no hint at any reaſon for this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy charge.</p>
                  <p>Others again fix the truth of this charge on our meetings, for our withdrawing of the people, from the allowed publict worship, and the perſons autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by law to diſpenſe the ſame. If the act had only circumſtantiated and deſcribed ſuch meetings, as had this effect, and not taken in all religious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fellowship in the duties of worship, ſomething might have been ſaid for juſtifying of this act, in a conformity to the principle of Church government, now ſetled by law, without a wound to true piety; but to make all meetings of Chriſtians, wherein any part of worship is exerciſed (without an expreſſe licence from the <hi>prelat</hi>) ſeminaries of ſeparation and rebellion, is in effect to condemne Chriſt, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Miniſters and Chriſtians, who, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Heatheniſme, Hereſy, Profainneſs and shiſme, have, under ſevere laws made againſt them, aſſembled and met together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for communion in the worship of God; whoſe aſſemblies have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unlawful Conventicles, and loaded with many of theſe evils, that are now charged on ours.

Although none will affirme this, yet we undertake to make it out, from the frame of this act, as it now ſtands. Oh that ſuch a law should be found in the records of this Nation, which will ſpeak (if ever we returne to ourſelves) to the shame and diſgrace of theſe times. But, as to our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the authorized publict worship, with which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome with great confidence, brand us, we shall conſider it afterwards, and ſee whether they or we be the ſeparatiſts.</p>
                  <p>We forbear to ſpeak to the penalties ſtatute in this act, againſt the contraveeners of it; which on many accounts might be made to appear, to be far beyond the demerite of the crime, and an imitation of the popish cruelty, who punished the Profeſſors of the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with punishments equal to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for treaſon; in which this act is not short, that adjudge the keepers of field Conventicles, to death and confiſcation of goods.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, it adds not alittle to our grief, under our preſent ſufferings; that although there be penal lawes againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and other heterodox per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet no notice is taken of them, nor any execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law upon them; yea in one act of Parl. <hi>Caroli.</hi> 2. <hi>Seſſion</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. they are exeemed from the guilt and ſeverity decreed againſt us: which ſeems ſtrange to us, when theirs and our principles, even in matters of civil government, are compared; theirs,

Not pretending to much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the lawes, we have alwayes underſtood, bonds to be voluntare, and firſt to proceed from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons found guilty, and ſentenced by the judge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the law; which the clemency of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat doeth often ſuſpend or remit, upon the guiltys
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:39286:33"/>offered and voluntare engagment for better behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in times comeing; and never required of nor impoſed on perſons, not proven nor found guilty. The truth is, if this violenting impoſition of bonds, be thus allowed and practiſed, what ground will there be thereby laid down, for the trouble and moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubjects? And who can promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecurity from the oppreſſion of others, that, out of malice or covetous deſignes, may, on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, give information againſt others, altho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo quiet and peaceable?</p>

                  <p>HAving thus far opened our hearts, and touched at ſome things, that are truly greivous to us; not ſo much for what we have ſuffered, as for the fear of what is like to be the conſequences of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, framed and ſet on foot, for perpetuating ours and the Churches oppreſſions, in this and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing generations: we shall in the next place give an accompt of our practiſe, in preaching and hearing of the Goſpel, diſpenſing and receiving of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at and from the hands of the ejected Miniſters; the new cauſe of theſe heavy acts, ſentences and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments inflicted on us, for the ſame: in doing of which we shall, firſt, in all ſinglneſs of heart, bring forth the true grounds and reaſons, binding our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to theſe practiſes, and then shall take off the exceptions that are moſt uſed againſt us.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:39286:33"/>
                  <p>Our practiſe, in this mater, we build on ſuch foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that all Chriſtians, eſpecially Proteſtants, by vertue of their profeſſed ſubjection to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, (our only King and Law giver in the houſe of our God) are bound to owne and adhere to, and from which they cannot recede, without contradicting of the ſaid profeſſion, and doing manifeſt violence to the law and word of Chriſt, the holy Scriptures, our only ſtatute and law book, in all matters of doctrine, worship and government. If on bringing our caſe to them, it shall be found, that our condemned practice in theſe ſtands juſtified, we hope with much aſſurance, we shall be acquited in the ſight of God, and in the conſciences of all that have any feeling and ſenſe of true Religion; the cenſures and talkings of others againſt us (which do not a little afflict us, for the ſad conſequences thereof to themſelves) shall not much move us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>firſt,</hi> the Miniſtery of the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by poſitive inſtitution and appointment from Chriſt Jeſus, as Head and King of his Church; and the perſons qualified for, and called thereto, in his own way, without dependance on the Powers of the earth, being thereby conſtitute his Ambaſſadors and meſſengers, and in ſpecial delegation ſent from him as ſuch, to preach the Goſpel, to treat with ſinners for reconciliation, and obedience; they by vertue of this inſtitution, and their ſpecial delegation or miſſion from him, are bound to exerciſe the Miniſtery &amp;c office, they are inveſted with, till it be taken from them in the way, by which he coveyed and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame upon them. If this be a truth (as no Chriſtian that doth acknowledge the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39286:34"/>of the holy Scriptures, and ſubjecte themſelves to its light and direction, will get refuſed) will it not follow that Miniſters, in their miniſterial capacity, are firſt and immediatly ſubject to Chriſt, and not to men, in their miniſtrations of the Goſpel? for they as his Ambaſſadours, having and deriveing all their power from him, are oblidged on higheſt paines, be reaſon of their ſpecial relation to him, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him, (which containes all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions) to do the work of the Miniſtery, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuperſeded therein by any, far leſs by them, that acknowledge Chriſts authority, in and over the Church, to be ſuperior to, and above all other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities whatſoever. If they had their power and miſſion from men, well might they ſubmit to theſe, in taking it from them; but it not being ſo, they cannot think themſelves diſcharged of their office, but in the way, by which He conferred the ſame upon them. Beleeve us, in this lyeth a great part of our difficulty: we are ſure, Miniſters are Chriſts meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſent by him, whom they are bound to ſerve, in preaching of the Goſpel and diſpenſing of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the ſalvation of ſinners, from which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation none can looſe them, but Chriſt Jeſus, their only maſter and head in this work. (2.) It does alſo natively flow from the former truth, that all, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe in and of the Church, are, by vertue of Chriſts ſupereminent, ſupream, and abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and their profeſſed ſubjection to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly bound to ſubject to the miniſterial autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and its exerciſe, in the perſons of thoſe whom he ſends, and that on the account of their miniſterial power &amp; office, which is truely Chriſts and not theirs;

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39286:35"/>they ſtand under to Chriſt Jeſus, have the Goſpel &amp; its ordinances committed &amp; intruſted to them, to be diſpenſed in his name, for the converſion and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſinners; for which they are called, the <hi>ſtewards of the myſteries of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4: 1. this is a talent they have received from their great Lord and maſter, of which they muſt shortly give an account; and which, while they have it, they are commanded in all higheſt paines to uſe, for the gaining of ſinners to him, in the ways he directs them to in his word. Now let all judge, what a ſtrait Miniſters are caſt into, in theſe times: If they forbear on the inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, to diſpenſe the Goſpel and its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to ſinners, thus committed to them, they prove unfaithful to their maſter, betray their truſt, and incurre his heavy diſpleaſure and wrath: If they anſwer their truſt and aime at faithfulneſs therein, in preaching of the Goſpel, and labouring in the work thereof, to gaine ſinners, they provock men and expoſe themſelves to all ſorts of ſuffering. But they, knowing the love and terror of the Lord, have on mature conſideration of this mater, choſen and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in their maſter's ſtrength, to venture on the wrath of men; ſeing they cannot, in this juncture, both pleaſe their Maſter &amp; them; reſolveing to prefer the neceſſity of ſuffering, to that of ſinne, the much commended and cryed-up choiſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Beſides this truſt of the Goſpel, there is likewiſe the heavy truſt of immortal ſouls (to whom they are ſent) committed to them, of whom they are to give an account, and for whoſe blood they muſt anſwer, when they reſigne and give up their

If they think ſo, they shall do well to produce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him, that will ſignify ſo much to them, without which they cannot judge themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eemed from the care and overſight of ſouls; whoſe blood will cry aloud in the ears of their maſter, if they do not their part, in what he hath commanded them, for ſaveing of ſuch. We have heard of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet from our Rulers to ſatisfy our conſciences in this mater, but peremptory lawes and acts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to obey the ſame, under great penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: If we were aſſured upon clear rational grounds, that their voice and commands were the voice and commands of Chriſt Jeſus, releeving us of this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing burden of immortal ſouls, once laid on us, how quickly and cheerfully should we obey their preſent laws: but nothing can we learne from them or any other, to aſcertane us of this. Let any, that hath any true feeling of the natural ſtate of ſouls, judge, what a cruelty it muſt be in us, to behold ſouls perishing throw ignorance, wickedneſſe, hypocriſy &amp; a Spirit of deluſion, in all parts of the Land, while we have the diſpenſation of the Goſpel committed to us, the mean that Chriſt hath appointed in his houſe, and uſeth to bleſs with power to the ſalvation of ſinners? Will not our neglect, in ſlighting of this, make us guilty of their blood, and acceſſory to their eternal perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? We are aſſured of this from the word of God.

We know the Miniſtery was inſtitute without a dependance on the Magiſtrat, and exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church, not only without, but againſt his will and command; and God was obeyed, while the Magiſtrat did countermand &amp; oppoſe himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to his outmoſt; which ſayes, that Miniſters and profeſſors did not then dreame of a dependance on, and ſubjection to the Magiſtrat, in the Maters of God: The truth is, to give the Magiſtrat a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to diſſolve powers inſtitute by God, and to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percede our obedience to him, in the things he hath commanded, is to make him equal with, if not to exalt him above the Almighty God; the only Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Univerſal Soveraigne of all Creatures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſuppoſe it will not be denyed to us, that the power of Magiſtrats is not ſimply abſolute, but ſeveral ways bounded and limited; as.
(1.) By its own nature, which is properly civil and politck.(2.) By its objects, Truth and Righteouſneſs, to which it is aſtricted, and beyond which, in its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, it cannot, <hi>jure,</hi> go.(3.) By the abſolute and univerſal authority of God and his laws, from which it and other powers are derived, and to which they are ſubordinat. All theſe limites are ſet to Magiſtracy, which it may not tranſgreſs; and beyond which, obedience is not due to theſe, that are inſtalled in it. By the <hi>firſt</hi> it is diſtinguished ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically trom other powers, as immediatly fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and deſcended from God, as it; as the power of Parents, of Husbands, Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp;c. ſome of which did exiſt and had being, before Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy was in the world. We aſſert that theſe powers, being ſpecifically different from Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and as immediatly derived from God, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat cannot, <hi>jure,</hi> diſannul them, hinder their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, nor diſſolve the obligations on thoſe veſted therewith, to thoſe duties to which they are antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently bound. It is true, the magiſtrat hath a power about theſe powers; but it is only cumulative, and not privative of the ſame: he is to ſee, that all do their duties in their ſeveral relations &amp; capacities, and that Truth, Righteouſneſs, and Peace be keeped, and flourish amonſt them. By the <hi>ſecond</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat is bound up, and tyed to, truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and hath no power to go beyond, far leſſe to do contrare to them; they being the eſſential objects and ends of magiſtracy, for the preſervation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:39286:40"/>of which, it was firſt inſtitute &amp; brought into the world. By the <hi>third</hi> the magiſtrat is ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to God and ſubordmated to him, (as all other powers are) that not only the right of precedency, in the mater of authority and obedience thereto, is Gods, and not the magiſtrats; but the magiſtrat is that much ſubjected to his law, as that he hath no <hi>jus,</hi> or power, to command any thing to the contrare: his commands here are nullities, as <hi>a non habenie Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem:</hi> ſo that non-obedience in this caſe is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to him; but obedience to God; for as God hath not given power to any of his creatures againſt himſelf; ſo in the Collation of the magiſtratical power and authority, there is an obligation convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it on the perſons called thereto, to improve and uſe the ſame for him, and the furtherance of obedience from others to his laws; for the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats power being of God, makes him the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, for the good and not the hurt of others. Hence it is evident and beyond diſput, with all ſober minded men, that the commands of the magiſtrat, do not binde any ſubject, where God commands the contrare. Court paraſites and flutterers may extend this power of the magiſtrat, beyond theſe, who through the love of their worldly intereſts and luſts, (when favoured and advanced by Rulers) more then from any true reſpect to their juſt authority and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, keep no bounds in their aſſertions about the magiſtrats power; but the true markes, and Land marks are ſet by God himſelf, and will not be removed, but to the prejudice and ruine of theſe that labour to overturne them. If we make it not out (as hath been hinted above) that, that which is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39286:41"/>commanded is ſinful, and contrare to the commands of the muſt high God, let us be uſed with all ſeverity; but noe are is granted to us, all acceſſe denyed, and every door shut up.</p>

But our adverſaries not finding ſufficient ground, for the former charge, take them to the actions, done in the times of our late troubles and confuſions, charging all that was then done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our party and their principles. <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are confident that, when the carriage &amp; actions of the true Presbyterian party, in relation to the Magiſtrat, shall be ſearched after, and known; they will be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient confutation of theſe malicious Calumnies caſt upon us, from this head: we know, for juſtifying of this charge, all the enormous actions of former times are fathered on our party, and their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but contrare to all juſtice; for we are ſure, if the actions of the late preceeding times were duely differenced, and diſtinguished into their ſeveral kindes, &amp; drawn up to their true fountaines &amp; heads, that theſe of them, that are not juſtifiable, shall be found to reſt on perſons and parties of deſignes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and principles different from ours, who for worldly reſpects and deſignes, betook themſelves to, and sheltered under the wings of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an party, while in power and ſuccesful (as it uſeth alwayes to be in ſuch caſes:) of theſe there were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent yea contrare ſorts, that winding into the favour of leading perſons in thoſe times, did climb up to that height of reputation and power, as to influence their counſels and actions, to the committing of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral enormities, that we dar not, yea will not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>But, (2.) We aſſert, that the exerciſe of the

We deſire then to know, what it is, that now ſuſpends the exerciſe of the Miniſterial power on the Magiſtrat, that was not then? Chriſtianity adds no new power or right to the Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſtrat, it only qualifies and diſpoſes him, to uſe his power aright; but gives none that he had not before: for if a heathenish Magiſtrat should exerciſe all that power about the Church and her paſtours, that is by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture allowed to the Chriſtian Magiſtrat, he should not exceed, nor go beyond the limits of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical power. As we finde ſeveral heathenish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats, in the Scriptures, doing a great part of the work aſcribed to the Chriſtian magiſtrat; (as <hi>Cyrus, Darius, Artaxerxes,</hi> &amp;c.) ſo they are commended for it. It is to us ridiculous, to ſay, that the heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enish magiſtrats power is not <hi>intenſive &amp; habitualiter</hi> as great, as the Chriſtian magiſtrats. 2. All moral power does neceſſarly include, and hath flowing from it, an obligation to its exerciſe, if moral and Phyſical impediments hinder not; it not only gives right to ſuch and ſuch acts, and makes them valide; but it binds the perſons cloathed therewith to ſuch acts, ſo that the omiſſion of them in their ſeaſon is their ſin; for the end of the power tyes the perſon, that hath it, to intend and ſeek its accomplishment, in ſuch and ſuch wayes, as is proper to the nature of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As the power of miniſters is from Chriſt by divine inſtitution: ſo they are under an obligation, for its exerciſe, by divine commands, which the magiſtrat hath no power to imped, as hath been ſaid. They that are cloathed with the miniſterial office, are commanded to exerciſe it, who, in no place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are directed to the magiſtrat, for his licenſe; If they be, let us ſee it: no doubt we had heard of it, ere this time, if any ſuch thing were.</p>

                     <hi>Exception</hi> 4. There is one exeption uſed againſt us among others, and urged with no little vehemency, in the matter of our loyaltie and obedience to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; to wit, our non-appearance before the Councel, on ſummonds given out againſt ſome of our number, at ſeveral occaſions; which is held forth to be, and ſtrongly aggravated for a high evidence of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of our Rulers, and the authoritie wherewith they are cloathed: for which up wards of 80. of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:39286:44"/>Gentlemen, Ladyes, Miniſters and yeomens are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercommuned; and the ſubjects, under the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltyes due to ſuch, inhibited all manner of aſſiſtance to, and converſe with them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not likeing to dip into, and diſcuſſe the ſeveritie of this ſentence of <hi>intercommuning,</hi> paſſed with ſuch ſolemnity againſt us, nor yet to canvaſſe the legality or illegalitie of it; but leaving it to others, better verſed in, and acqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inted with our Lawes; we offer the following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to all, which we hope will, to the unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed, not only alleviat but juſtify our non-appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. (1.) Beſide what the law of nature hath provided and teaches all men, anent ſelf preſervation; we ſuppoſe, it will not be denyed, but granted to us by all, that, if many of the precepts and examples we have in the word of God, do allow flight to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Chriſtians from the unjuſt violence and oppreſſion of Rulers, when it is within their power to decline it; then our non-apperance before the Councel wil not neceſſarily inferre a contempt of their authority, or any true diſloyaltie and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them: Otherwiſe Chriſt Jeſus our bleſſed head, his Apoſtles and others, will be found as chargeable with this crime, as we; from which all Chriſtians do free them. While we think on theſe precepts and examples of Chriſt, his Apoſtles and Chriſtians, who lived in Scripture times, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid theſe two concluſions, which in deſpite of all contradiction do make out the former inference, as 1. That paſſive obedience to the unrighteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and punishments of Rulers, is as undue, as active obedience to their unjuſt commands: injuſtice in ſentences and punishments, binds no more to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39286:44"/>to theſe, then unrighteouſnes in commands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yes to obedience, where the infliction of ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments is evitable; for Rulers are not enabled by their authority to injuſtice more in the one, then they are in the other; and conſequently there can be no obligation on their ſubjects from their authoritie, to give themſelves up to their unjuſt punishments, more then to yeeld obedience to their iniquous commands: &amp; if it were not ſo, Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſinned in not giving this obedience: which is moſt abſurd. <hi>Obj:</hi> 1. But this is contrarie to the doctrine of many Proteſtants, who teach that paſſive obedience is due, and should be given, where active obedience is not? <hi>Anſ:</hi>
1. We know of no Proteſtants that teach ſo, except thoſe who were proſy lited into court paraſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; it was neither the doctrine nor practice of moſt Proteſtants, as is clear from their writings and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.2. We deſire to know of them that thinke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, what this allowed flight is, If it be not a remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ourſelves (when the circumſtances of caſes permit) from the decrees and ſentences of Rulers, appointing us to unjuſt punishments? which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a denying of paſſive obedience to ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. Who can evite this? Some there are who grant this, in ſentences that reach the life; but not in ſentences that only touch the body and eſtate, as impriſonments, fines, exile, &amp;c. But give not any juſt inſtances, or ſound reaſon for what they aſſert. <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. Hence alſo we gather from the foreſaid precepts and examples, that non-ſubmiſſion to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſentences, when within our power, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that reſpect, eſteem, love, honour and obedience, which, by vertue of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39286:45"/>we are bound to give to Rulers; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is no contempt of their authority, nor any true diſloyalty; els Chriſt in allowing himſelf, and his Apoſtles in practiſing this flight, had been contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of authoritie and diſloyal to it: which all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians aſſert to be falſe. Hence it is evident, and will be ſo to the unprejudged, that if our Oppoſites faſten not this charge on the mater, they will never be able to do it from our non-appearance ſimply and abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly conſidered. <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Our Rulers ſummonds being properly their commands to us. for our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arance before them, (which is lawful and in its ſelf juſt) we were bound to have appeared, both on the account of their authority, and the thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <hi>Anſ.</hi> This being the objection of greateſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength, and moſt uſed to our reproach, we shall conſider it a little, and
(1.) Waveing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about the nature of ſummonds, and leaving their native import, uſe and conſequences to Lawyers; We aſſert, that when the commands of Superiors, (altho lawful in their immediat object or matter) are, in their ſtated deſigne, ſo connected with irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, injuſtice, oppreſſion and unrighteouſnes, that they become the engines and means of oppreſſion and violence, or of any thing truely ſinful in its ſelf; we ſay, ſuch commands participat of the nature of their ends, and become unjuſt: as for inſtance, when Rulers in order to oppreſſion and perſecution, command any ſubject to witneſs his knowledge of the Orthodox opinions and practiſes of ſuch and ſuch perſons, the ſubject in this caſe ought not to obey ſuch commands; which our of this caſe and the like, that are abſtract from ſuch ſinful ends, he not only may, but ought
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39286:45"/>to obey; or if a maſter or father should require his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or ſon to bring to him ſuch a woman to ſuch a place, they knowing it is for commiting of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with her, they should not obey; which, when without reſpect to this wicked end, they are bound to do. If this were not a truth, the officers and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that apprehended Chriſt and Crucified him, were innocent and blamleſſe: which all grant to be falſe, for it was the injuſtice of the ends of their lawful Rulers commands in this thing, that made their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them undue and unjuſt, ſo that they were truely culpable and guilty of Chriſts blood, as well as their Rulers.(2.) Suppoſeing but not granting, the ſummones to be good &amp; juſt in themſelves; yet it is a Maxime agreed to by all Divines, that where two things morally good, doe t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yſt in Chriſtians practice, the one of one or two degrees of goodnes, the other of three or foure, that the laſt should be choſen and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the firſt: but ſo it fell out to be in our caſe. To our thoughts on this matter, it was beyond queſtion, that our non-appearance at theſe times, to which we were cited, was a greater good (ſupponing the other to be good, which we do not yeeld) both to the Magiſtrat, our ſelves and others, then our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance could have been; for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reby the Magiſtrat was withheld from unjuſt oppreſſion, he should have been guilty of, the Goſpel preſerved with the people in its purity, much ſuffering to others prevented &amp;c. while we had no good to expect from our appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but a meer act of obedience.(3.) That non-obedience, in ſome caſes and things, to the commands of Rulers, is no true diſobedience, as
(1.) In things without the Magiſtrats line and reach,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:39286:46"/>altho the things commanded be juſt and good in themſelves: ſuppone the Magiſtrat should command a perſon unordained, to preach the Goſpel, diſpenſe the Sacraments, &amp;c. this being beyond the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats line, it were no diſobedience in any ſubject, not to obey ſuch commands.(2.) In things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire to mercy and juſtice, that one Subject oweth to another, if the Magiſtrat command either the not doing of theſe, or the doing of the contrare; not obeying here, is no diſobedience. The truth is, if the mater commanded be not juſt, and, antecedent to the Magiſtrats commands, not neceſſare; not obeying is no diſobedience; and the reaſon is, becaus no power can juſtly crave obedience, when it acts either beyond, or againſt its true adequat formal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: but of this above.(3.) When Magiſtrats commands are oppoſite to Gods, (which hath often fallen out) obedience to God can be no diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Magiſtrat. But in our caſe we undertake to prove, that altho the thing commanded, to wit, appearance, be within the compaſſe of the Magiſtrats power, that it was contrare to mercy and juſtice; yea and things commanded and allowed us of God; which will exeem our non-appearance from diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, &amp; conſequently from contempt of Authority.</p>
                  <p>Knowing and being morally certaine, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt violence, deſigned againſt us, would have inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably followed on our appearance, we chuſed rather to forbear it, and to uſe the flight Chriſt allowes to his ſervants and people, in the like caſes. It is a Maxime in Morals or practical divinty, accorded to by all Divines, that of two penal evils, when the election of them is in our arbitriment, the leſſer is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:39286:46"/>to be preferred to the greater: And to any that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the caſe, we then had before us, it will be manifeſt, that flight was much preferable to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we were to expect on appearance, of which we were aſſured, not only from the ſtanding lawes of the Kingdome, but likwiſe from the preceeding carriage of our Rulers; who, altho ſlow and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enough in the execution of the lawes againſt <hi>Papiſts, Quakers,</hi> and other heterodox opinious and wicked practiſes; yet punctual and ſtrick, in puting the law to more then its full execution againſt us; to which they have been, and are inſtigated by our enemies, the Prelats, to ſuch a hight of keenneſs, that if the mater contamed in our ſummonds cannot be made to appear, we are put to anſwer ſuch interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and required to give and ſubſcribe ſuch oaths, engadgments and bonds, to which, they know, we cannot without deſtroying of our principles yeeld; for refuſeing of which, many of our party have been caſt into priſons, fined, banished, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It had no little influence on us in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining our non-appearance, that the uſual legal forme of procedour in judgment, allowed to and uſed vvith others, is not obſerved towards us; from which we could not expect juſtice, but all ſeverity. On our appearance we have no accuſer, often no ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel condeſcending on, or containing our crimes, with the circumſtances; no witneſſes produced; but an oath adminiſtred to the empannelled, for expiſcating of accuſations againſt ourſelves and others, and that in crimes made by law capital; and the oaths of theſe, whom the law calls, <hi>ſocij criminis,</hi> ſuſtained for valid probation; wayes of procedour condemned
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39286:47"/>by the law of God and nations, except where the Papiſts cruelty takes place. And if all theſe ſail, the ſubſcribing of engagments and bonds is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>opoſed &amp; required (as is ſaid above;) on the refuſal of which, a priſon is the beſt we meet with. Let any man of ordinare reaſon and juſtice judge, whether appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before Rulers, who, by following of ſuch methods and wayes in judgment, declare themſelves reſolved to have at the perſons arraigned, whether <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Among other things, that came under conſideration with us againſt this appearance, was the oath <hi>de ſuper inquirendis,</hi> lately framed into a law, and now preſſed on us, which (for the reaſons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given) we dar not take; for beſids the ſevere punishments (as impriſonment, arbitrary fines, exile to forraigne plantations, &amp;c.) we were to look for, for refuſeing of this oath; if we take it, we are, contrare to all natural equity, mercy and juſtice, made the accuſers of ourſelves and others, contrare to the proviſion made in the act eſtablishing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeing of this oath, which declares that the oath taken by any shall not militat in judgment againſt the takers of it to ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39286:47"/>the deponent; ſeing a perſon's own confeſſion of his crimes is judged ſufficient againſt him, much more should this oath, which neceſſarly ſuppons and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers confeſſion, even judicial.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Fiftly,</hi> In the next place, the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that by our appearance, we were certane, would have redounded to many, made us forbear it; for if we had appeared, we were ſure perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, or exile from our native countrey, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued thereon; whereby we should have been put out of a capacity, for labouring the preſervation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Goſpel in this Church, of which we are members, and to which we, as Miniſters and Chriſtians, are ſo ſtraitly tyed and bound; the people should have been robbed of a faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

1. That it is not every ſort of ſeparation, that is ſinful and evil; ſome kinds of it are duty and commanded, as our Proteſtant divines make good againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph Hall,</hi>

                     </gap> all that writ on that ſubject: for it is our part,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39286:48"/>to ſeparat from ſin, and Profeſſors joyning together in it, with which the worship of God comes too often to be vitiated, and polluted: for this we have many precepts and commands in the word <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5: 11. with other Scriptures.2. To make non-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or abſence from the meetings of Chriſtians for worship and goverment, ſinful ſeparation, there muſt be <hi>firſt</hi> a ſtated habitual abſence, <hi>ſecondly</hi> Such reaſons and grounds for it, as will not juſtify it; for if the abſence be not ordinare, it is not eſteemed ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; altho the reaſons of it be not juſtifiable <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc:</hi> and albeit the abſence be ordinare and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, yet if its cauſes, whether moral or phyſical, be right and warrantable, it is not ſinful ſeparation; for abſence from the meetings of Chriſtians in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or government, is either ſinful or not, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cauſes or reaſons of it.3. The grounds that will juſtify and warrant a withdrawing, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare, from ſuch meetings, muſt be.
(1.) The want of a juſt authority or right, in thoſe that diſpenſe the ordinances of worship and government: The <hi>Phariſees</hi> queſtion propoſed to Chriſt, Matth. 21: 23. did ſuppone a commonly granted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived truth, which Chriſt does not deny, but tacitly yeelds; that they who act publickly in the Church muſt have a juſt authority &amp; right ſo to do: we ought to have ſome rational convincing evidence of this, &amp; if it be wanting, it will warrant this withdrawing; much more, if its want be poſitively clear.(2.) Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the worship of God, ſo knit to them in their uſe, that they cannot be uſed without the uſe of theſe corruptions, will alſo allow a withdrawing from ſuch roeetings; as all <hi>in theſe</hi> grant.(3.)

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39286:49"/>as ſuch places, times, cauſes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp;c. That in their connexion with, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to things, that are truely ſinful and evil, beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſo, <hi>prohic &amp; nunc;</hi> as faſts, thankſgivings, &amp;c. when obſerved at ſuch times, and for ſuch Cauſes, as are evil.(4.) Unſound and heretical doctrine, taught in ordinare, in ſuch meetings, Matth. 24. We grant it is not every error and erronious doctrine, that will juſtifie a peoples withdrawing, from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, diſpenſed in the aſſemblies of the Church, (there being nothing beſides that may juſtly cauſe it;) but only ſuch as is truely heretical and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the foundations of Religion, Righteouſneſs, &amp; peace. When poiſon is adminiſtred in ſtead of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, a people are bound to ſee to their own ſafety, that they be not deſtroyed by that, which was intended for their health.(5) There are ſome things in the ſtated caſe of ſome times, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that will give ſufficient ground for this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, that will not do it at other times; as in the beginnings of defection, under the conteſts betwixt the orthodox and unſound party, uſually ſome things fall in, that will call for a ſeceſſion from Church aſſemblies; which have often fallen out in the Church, and is evident from hiſtory; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the time of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> predomining in the Church of <hi>Holland;</hi> and many others that are to be ſeen in the records of the Church.4. Although in ſome caſes, a negative ſeparation be lawful and right, where a poſitive is not; yet in ſome caſes, a poſitive ſeparation is lawful and duty: it is hard to determine of caſes in this matter, except where the eaſe hath been, or els is exiſtent: there are two caſes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:39286:49"/>in which this is allowed; intruſion, and an univerſall infection of the worship and government of the Church, with ſuperſtition, idolatry and tyranny, to the polluting of all its ordinances: we hope there will be no controverſy anent the ſecond, ſeing it is the doctrine, and hath been the practice, of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, in their ſeceſſion and departur from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> on that very head; who not only withdrew from the communion of that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Church; but erected themſelvs into diſtinct Churches, with officers and ordinances, conforme to the commands and inſtitution of Chriſt: and when the mater is ſeriouſly and impartially weighted, there will be found, as little ground of controverſy about the firſt; anent which we take theſe two to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truths.
(1.) That Churches are not bound to ſubject to, but to withdraw from theſe intruded upon them; partly becauſe the juſt rights of the Church are wronged and taken from her, which all ought to maintaine, and not to quite, &amp; partly becauſe she is enſlaved thereby, and ſubjected to the luſts &amp; tyranny of men, and a preparative laid downe to oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs for doing of the like, in times coming.(2.) That this intruſion is either on Churches that have bin and are ſetled in Chriſts way, with able and faithful Miniſters; or elſe on theſe that want &amp; are vacant for the time: If it be on Churches that are under the ſetled inſpection of faithful Miniſters, they are bound to adhere to theſe, and not to give place to the intruders, from whom to withdraw, can be no ſinful ſeparation; the intruders, and theſe that fall off to them, are the ſeparatiſts: if the Church or Churches be without faithful Miniſters, they alſo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:39286:50"/>are obleidged to refuſe the intruding Miniſters; and if this unjuſt and violent intruſion on them continue, they are oblidged to provide themſelves of Miniſters, that under their overſight, they may have and enjoy the benefite of the Goſpel and its ordinances, to which by the commands of Chriſt, and the neceſſity of the means of eternal life, they are ſtraitly bound; for as unjuſt intruſion brings nothing with it, to make a people yeeld to the intruders; ſo it untys no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion formerly on them, for endeavouring of their ſetlment with a faithful Miniſtery. If we thought theſe, <hi>in theſi,</hi> were queſtioned by any, we could with great eaſe make them out to the conviction of all; but taking them for granted, we ſurceaſe any further probation. Therefore5. We deſire, it may be alſo conſidered, that there is a vaſt difference betwixt hearing of, and ſubmiting to Miniſters, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Miniſtery, in the general; and doing of theſe to ſuch and ſuch Miniſters: the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and our adverſaries, is not whether we should hear and ſubmit to Miniſters in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, for this we do not deny; but whether we should hear and ſubmit to theſe, that were our Miniſters &amp; ſet over us by the holy Ghoſt, before this change in the Church; or theſe ſent from and thruſt in upon us, by the Magiſtrat and Prelates? It is no little wrong done us by our enemies, who give it out to the world, that we contemne a Miniſtery &amp; ordinances, and are againſt hearing; while our practice, declares the contrare to all, and for which we are dayly ſuffering. We hold that, as it is our duty to withdraw from, and not to ſubject to the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>s, and their Creaturs; ſo it is likwiſe our duty, to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:39286:50"/>cleave to our former Miniſters, in hearing of the Goſpel, and receiveing of ordinances from them, as we can, &amp; have acceſs: we have given reaſons for the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, &amp; shall, the Lord willing, do the like for the negative.6. It would alſo be adverted, that there is a great difference, betwixt a Churches bringing in, and carrying on of a defection willingly, in a Church way; and the Magiſtrats doing this of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without the Church, yea forcibly, <hi>Eccleſia renitente ac reclamante;</hi> although there should be no difference, as to the mater; yet there is much as to the maner and way, to influence, regular and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie miniſters and Chriſtians carriage under them: all in the Church are to ſubject to the power, proper and peculiar to her, which they ought not to do to others, uſurping this power, and taking it out of her hands.7. In this mater a difference or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be made, betwixt the perſonal ſcandals and corruptions in miniſters walk, and adminiſtration of holy things; and theſe that may be, or are found in the way of their entry, which may be ſuch, that although they do not invalidate their miniſterie, in their diſpenſing of the word and its ordinances, to the rendering of theſe nullities; yet may give ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground to peoples withdrawing from and not ſubjecting to them, as their lawful and ſent paſtours.8. There is a great difference betwixt a Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly conſtitute according to the Word of God, in her miniſterial political being, enjoying the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all ordinances in purity, that comes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, while under that conſtitution, to be intruded upon by the ſole power of the Magiſtrat, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in officers and members for adhereing to her
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39286:51"/>conſtitution, in oppoſition to the intruders, and the corruptions brought in upon her by them, againſt her conſent; and a Church declining from her former purity, in doctrine, worship and government, abuſeing her power to the bringing in and furthering of the ſaid defection, and univerſally concurred with, and ſubmited to in the ſame. The firſt is our caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y lay on us.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion then betwixt us, and our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is not whether we may lawfully ſeparat from publict ordinances, for the corruptions and perſonal miſcarriages of fellow-worshipers, whether mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or others; as one in a little <hi>manuſcript</hi> doeth maliciouſly or ignorantly ſtate it: we are ſtill of the ſame minde with our worthy predeceſſours in their debats againſt the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts;</hi> as our practice this day doeth confirme, in our aſſemblies and meetings for worship, differing in nothing, as to this, from what it was before. Neither is it, whether it be ſimply or in it ſelf ſinful, to hear &amp; receive ordinances from theſe, who have entered by, &amp; ſubmitted to the <hi>prelates,</hi> abſtract from our preſent caſe; for we grant the caſe may be, in which it is lawful yea duty to hear, and receive ordinances from ſuch; yea and hath been. But the true ſtate of the queſtion, is, whether a Church or Churches conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute according to the rules of the word, provided and ſettled with miniſters, regularly called and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, should yeeld to the Magiſtrats and Prelates, violently ejecting their miniſters, and thruſting in other miniſters upon her, not only without, but againſt her conſent; in ſubjecting to ſuch, hearing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39286:51"/>and receiving of ordinances from them; while the Magiſtrat does all this, for furthering and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a courſe of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fection, contrare to ſolemne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and oaths, by which they were oftener then once, ejected and caſt out of this Church? To this we <hi>anſwer</hi> negatively; that the Church should not ſubject to ſuch in hearing, and receiving of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from them, but ought to diſowne, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from theſe, thus entered into the Church, and complying with the introduced corruptions.</p>
                  <p>This concluſion we prove thus. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They who have no juſt authority, nor right to officiat fixedly in this Church, as the proper paſtores of it, ought not to be received, but withdrawne from: But the Prelates and their adherents, the <hi>Curates,</hi> have no juſt authority nor right to officiat in this Church, as her proper paſtours: Therefore they ought not to be received but withdrawne from. It is expected, they will not deny the <hi>firſt propoſition:</hi> all the debate will be about the <hi>ſecond,</hi> which we make out thus. They who have entered into, and do officiat fixedly in this Church, without her authority and conſent, have no juſt authority and right ſo to do: but the Prelates and their Curats have entered into this Church, and do officiat therein, without her authority and conſent: therefore they have not juſt authority, &amp;c. The <hi>firſt propoſition</hi> is clear, and we ſuppoſe will not be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid by our Antagoniſts; ſeing the power of miſſion, of calling and ſending of ordinare fixed paſtours, is only in the Church, and not in any other, as all Divines do aſſert. The <hi>Second</hi> is evident from maters of fact: for there was no Church judicatory called or convocated, for bringing of the Prelats into this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:39286:52"/>Church; all was done immediatly by the King &amp; acts of Parliament, without the Church (she being by violence diſenabled to meet in her officers for fear of oppoſition from them;) a practice wanting a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in this and (for any thing we know) in all other Churches. <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But our Prelats were conſecrat by the Prelats of the Church of <hi>England? Anſ.</hi> What ſignifies that to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their juſt right to officiat in her (ſuppone the office of prelacie were right and inſtitute?) Does any think, the Church of <hi>England</hi> would acknowledge the authority of Prelats conſecrat here, and ſubject to the ſame, if all were done not only without but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her conſent; we ſuppoſe not. Either the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at that time, had no power of miſſion, or els she had; if she had none, wanting prelacy, then our Miniſters were no Miniſters of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and all ordinances diſpenſed in her for many years were nullities, which ſome of our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we hope, will not ſay: if she had the power of miſſion, how came she to be neglected and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon by another Church, to whom she was not ſubordinat? <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But Presbyters cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat Bishops, they being an inferior order. <hi>Anſ.</hi> if it could be shown from Scripture that Bishops are not only an Order and office different from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but that they have a different ordination to their office, from that of Presbyters, it would ſay much; but nothing of this can be made to appear from the Word of God. But. 2. We ask whether conſecration be different from ordination? If it be one with the ſame, why may not Presbyters conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat? and if they may ordaine (as we undertake to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:39286:52"/>make out from Scripture and Antiquitie) what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie was there for going to <hi>England</hi> for it, ſeing it might have been done by the Presbyters of this Church? If conſecration differ from ordination, ſure it is a humane cuſtome and invention, for which we have nothing in the Scriptures and pure Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that only ſpeaks of ordination, the only way, in which all Paſtors entered into the paſtoral office. 3. The truth is, as a Church Miniſterial and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, conſtitute according to the Word of God, with all officers of divine appointment, hath the full power of the keys of the kingdome of God; ſo there is no ſort of officer, neceſſare by divine inſtitution to her edification, but she is enabled, to furnish her ſelf with ſuch, without a neceſſitie of ſeeking to other Churches for them: and if it be ſo, the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of this Chruch, being her repreſentatives, their conſent should have been had. Although we had no juſt exception againſt the office of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as it is conſtitute and declared by law (as we have) but their violent intruſion in this Church, it puts a ſufficient bar on our ſubjection to them, ſo that we may not, yea cannot owne them as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſtors of this Church, <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. The Magiſtrat conſented to and procured their conſecration? <hi>Anſ.</hi> If any will make it appear, that the Magiſtrat is the Church (as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> does inſolently aſſert without all probation) yea a member of it, as ſuch, or hath the power of miſſion, we shall yeeld the cauſe and quietly ſubmit: but when we ſearch into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we find the Magiſtrat, as a Profeſſor of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity a member of the Church without all Church power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:39286:53"/>as ſuch to the care and overſight of Church Officers, in the exerciſe of their miniſterial authority and power. We grant, it is his part to put the Miniſters of the Church (when negligent in furnishing of her with officers) to their duty anent it; but not to thruſt in officers upon her of himſelf without her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. But the Curats have entered by the Church? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This we deny: the contrare is clear from conſtant practice; for the Curats come in upon congregations only by the Bishop and Patron, who are not the Church, nor have any power from her for what they do, in this: all their right and power is founded upon, and derived from the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and acts of Parliament, and not from the Church; in which the Bishop acts as the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legat and ſubſtitute, only impowered thereto by his law: ſo that the Curats having and deriving all their power from the Prelates, cannot have the ſame from the Church; none gives what he hath not. But. 2. The prelates, not being the lawful governing Church, any that enter congregations by them, cannot be ſaid to enter by the Church; no more then if a Miniſter should enter into a congregation of this Church by a Miniſter or Miniſters of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> without the Miniſters of this Church, can be ſaid to enter by the Church here; for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of other Churches are not the governing Church of this Church. The antecedent is to us clear; for as the Prelates have entered without the Church; ſo the lawful Miniſterial ruling Church, although ſcattered and perſecuted, is yet exiſtent and in being, who by the unjuſt and violent intruſion of others, have not loſt their right of ruleing this Church; but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39286:53"/>in point of right and obligation do continue to be her lawful paſtours; for violence, perſecution and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, do not diſſolve the relation betwixt the Church and her Paſtours, either general or particular; there being nothing in our caſe, that can juſtly do it; other wayes, it should be in the power of the Magiſtrat, to undo and deſtroy the political Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Church, both formally and effectively which is ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ord. We ask at any, who think perſecution and intruſion do in our caſe annul the paſtoral relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Miniſters and Churches; whether the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats violent ejecting of Miniſters, and puting of <hi>Mahum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We ask a reaſon. If they judge perſecution and intruſion by the Magiſtrat in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his caſe, to have this effect; then it will inevitably follow, that the Magiſtrat can deſtroy divine commands flowing there from, contrare to the practice of divine relations, &amp; obligations to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Church, in the primitive times, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of the Magiſtrats Edicts, threatnings, &amp; much actual violence, performed the mutual duties of paſtours and flocks.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. All power of the Prelates and their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs in the Church is by law fountained in and derived from the Magiſtrat, and in its exerciſe ſubordinated to him; (as is evident from the <hi>act of reſtitution.

That the force of this Argument may be more perſpicuous and clear, we shall put it into forme thus: Thoſe that receive and derive their Church power from, and are ſubordinat in its exerciſe to another head, then Chriſt Jeſus, should not be received and ſubjected to, as the miniſters of Chriſt in his Church: But the Prelats and their Curats do receive, and derive their Church power from, and are ſubordinat, in its exerciſe, to another head then Chriſt Jeſus: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought not to be received and ſubjected to, as the miniſters of Chriſt in his Church. We ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>firſt propoſition</hi> will not be denyed; all the debate will be in the <hi>Second,</hi> Which we prove thus; Theſe officers in the Church profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch, that derive their Church power from, and are ſubordinat, in its exerciſe, to a power truely Architectonick and ſupream in the Church, beſide Chriſt, doe derive their power from and are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat in its exerciſe to another head, then Chriſt Jeſus: But ſo it is, that the Prelates and their creaturs, do derive their Church power from, and are ſubordinat in its exerciſe to a power truely Architectonick and ſupream in the Church, beſide Chriſt; therefore the Prelates and their Curates do derive their power from, and are ſubordinat in its exerciſe to another head, then Chriſt. The <hi>major propoſition</hi> is evident: for whoever hath a ſupream Architectonick power, in and over the Church, muſt be an head to the ſame, and the fountaine of all Church power: it is a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:39286:54"/>to be ſupream, &amp; have an Architectonick power, and not to be the head of that Society, to which any is ſuch. Now to the <hi>Minor,</hi> that the Prelats and their Curats have their power from, and in its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe are ſubjected to a ſupream Architectonick power, is beyond diſput clear, from the <hi>act of reſtitution,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, and other acts to be mentioned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; and will be ſo to any that conſideratly peruſe the ſame; of which we are to ſpeak at more large, under the laſt head; but for the time, we propoſe theſe three from theſe acts, for making out of this argument.
1. They are expreſly made to have a dependance upon and ſubordination to the King, as ſupream to them, in their Church judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and adminiſtrations.2. The government of the Church, in its ordering and diſpoſeing, is annexed to the crowne, as one royal prerogative thereof, which not only ſuppons the government to be in him, as the fountaine thereof, but to be exerciſed with that dominion, that is ſuteable to his regality.3. The giving of Church power to Church officers, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to be the effect and deed of his lawes, and acts, without which, all power in the Church is declared to be null and void. <hi>Objec.</hi> Although the Kings Majeſty be ſupream governour in all cauſes, and over all perſons Eccleſiaſtical; yet he is not head to and of the Church? <hi>Anſ.</hi> If he be ſupream governour in ſuch cauſes and over ſuch perſons, <hi>in Linea directa,</hi> no queſtion, he is the head political to the Church; for <hi>GOVERNOUR</hi> &amp; <hi>HEAD</hi> are equipollent terms: whoſoever is ſupream Governour to any ſociety, in this ſenſe, is a proper political head to it; it is needleſs to quarrel about words, if the thing be granted. And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39286:55"/>that this ſubordination or ſupremacy is direct, or <hi>in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea directa,</hi> is, we judge, clear from the fore mentioned acts, ſeing they not only make the King the fountaine of Church power; but moreover in the <hi>act anent the the National Synod,</hi> he is made the <hi>All</hi> of the ſame, and without him, it is nothing. The like of theſe, the ſun never shined on, except theſe made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. of <hi>England;</hi> which being ſcrupuled at by all ſorts of perſons, at home &amp; abroad, they were, in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, forced to alleviat the mater by removeing the title <hi>head,</hi> and ſome mitigating explications allowed, and ordered to be given to the ſubjects, at the taking of the oath of ſupremacy; but no ſuch explications allowed here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If the Miniſters and Churches required by law to receive and ſubmit to the Prelats, and their Curats thus thruſt in upon them, were conſtitut and ſetled in Chriſts way, as Paſtors and flocks, in the juſt poſſeſſion and actual uſe of all ordinances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the rules of the word; then it is no ſinful ſeparation, for Churches, in adhering to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, not to receive nor ſubmit to the Prelates and their Curats: But ſo it is, that the Miniſters and Churches required by law to receive and ſubmit to the Prelats and their Curats, thus thruſt in upon them, were conſtitut and ſetled, in Chriſts way, as Paſtors and flocks, in the juſt poſſeſſion and actual exerciſe of all ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>o ſinful ſeparation on their part, not to receive and ſubmit to the Prelats and their Curats, in hearing and receiving of ordinances from them. We ſuppoſe, the <hi>conſequence</hi> of the <hi>major propoſition</hi> is evident, and will not readily be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39286:55"/>denyed by any; and if it ſhall happen to be, we prove it thus. If there be divine obligations on Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and their Churches to the performance of the mutual duties of Paſtors and flocks; then it can be no ſinful ſeparation, for Churches, in adhering to their Miniſters, not to receive nor ſubmit to the Prelats and their Curats; But ſo it is, that the Miniſters and Churches, required by law to receive and ſubmit to the Prelats and their Curats, were under divine obligations to the performance of the mutual duties of Paſtors and flocks: Therefore it is no ſinful ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Churches not to receive nor ſubmit to the Prelats and their Curats. The <hi>conſequence</hi> of the <hi>major propoſition</hi> leaneth upon theſe two, and is infallibly made out by them, <hi>firſt</hi> that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

We ask at the Patrons of Prelacy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they judge it eſſential to the conſtitution of the Miniſterial political Church? If they judge it eſſential, doth it not neceſſarily follow, that all the Reformed Churches of <hi>France, Holland,</hi> &amp;c. are no miniſterial Political Churches; and that all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances diſpenſed in them are Nullities; yea that the Churches of the <hi>vallyes</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> called the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes.</hi> (which by all hiſtorians have their original deduced from the Apoſtles,) were not ſuch, ſeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:39286:56"/>their begining of Chriſtianity to this day, which is contrare to the ſenſe and judgment of our Worthy Reformers, who alwayes eſteemed them pure Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The truth is, the conſequence is ſo neceſſare, that the moſt of the Prelatical party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> admit no Miniſter of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to officiat among them without reordination; by which they fix a deſperat Schiſme between them and theſe Churches, while they deſire and endeavour reconciliation with <hi>Rome:</hi> which ſpeaks out the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of their principles? If they think Prelacy not eſſential to the Political Miniſterial Church? (as ſome of them do grant?) then our Church conſtitution, as to all eſſentials, was right, our Paſtores bound to feed, and people to ſubmit, hear and receive ordinances from them; <hi>Obj.</hi> Although Prelacy be not eſſential to the <hi>eſſe;</hi> yet it is usful and neceſſare to the well being of the Miniſterial Church? <hi>Anſ.</hi>
1. As hath been ſaid above, we know of no good, to which Prelacy is ſaid to be neceſſate, that is not eaſily attainable without it; yea and is not win at in the reformed Churches.2. Then the former obligation on our Paſtores and this Church muſt continue; for if Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy be not eſſential nor neceſſare to the being of the Miniſterial Churches, the obligation, which flowes from, and is dependant on it, cannot be diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the introduction of Prelacy upon us; it should rather confirme and ſtrengthen this obligation, in the opinion of ſuch, then diſſolve it. It is, no queſtion, the foreſight of this and other conſequences of the like nature, that forces the moſt of the now Prelats, to maintaine the abſolute and eſſential neceſſity of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy in the Church, againſt the evidence of Script<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

It is true, <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> is at much paines to prove it to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but on ſuch grounds as shake the foundation of our faith, the perfection of the holy Scriptures; and with ſo little ſucceſſe, as we remaine the more confirmed in the contrare: wo were to us, if we had no better grounds for Presbytery, then the ſtrongeſt pleaders for Prelacy have yet shewed for it.2. The Magiſtrat with the ſubject being under the divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Covenants and oaths againſt Prelacy, have no power to command its reception, neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:39286:58"/>horrid ſin againſt God: If in ſuch a caſe, a power in the Magiſtrat to do, and command contrare to ſuch divine obligations and engagements, and an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on the ſubject to obey theſe, be aſſerted, is there not a door opened to the introduction of any Religion what ſoever? And a power granted to and eſtablished in the Magiſtrat, to make void all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience to God? Which, to us, is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think on. Are not our Antagoniſts then forced, either to aſſert this power on the Magiſtrat; Or els to prove the mater of theſe Covenants to be ſinful and unjuſt, and conſequently not obligatory on this Church? One of theſe two they muſt do, before they can expect our obedience to the preſent lawes anent it. We grant, ſome of that party have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken this task, as to the laſt; but with ſo ſmall fruit, that on a ſerious and impartial peruſal of their Argueings about it, we continue more confirmed in the contrare, then before the ſaid peruſal: whether this proceeds from our dulneſs and incapacity to reach their arguments, or the weakneſs of the ſame, we leave it to the unbyaſſed to judge.3. We aſſert, that whatever the Magiſtrat may do, either in cauſing or diſſolveing of Church relations and engagments; yet he cannot do this, immediatly and of himſelf, but by the Church; and the reaſon is; as the fixing and eſtablishing of Churches relations and engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments betwixt Miniſters and Churches, does ariſe and flow from Chriſts inſtitutions and precepts in his word; ſo the application of theſe to individuals in the Church, either in cauſing or diſſolveing them, is in the Church, and not in the Magiſtrat: he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Church to act her part in this, but cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

(4.) <hi>Abiathers</hi> punishment, to which he was formally ſentenced, was purely civil, confinement to ſuch a place: Ours, altho it be partly civil, yet is moſtly Eccleſiaſtick; (which is not within the power of the Magiſtrat) we are not only robed of our lively-hoods and contined; but inhibited the exerciſe of our Miniſtrie, and ſtated by ſentence, in a habitual ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from the exerciſe of it, which is truely dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If congregations have a juſt right and power of electing and calling of their Miniſters; then thoſe that come in upon them without this, are not to be eſteemed their Paſtours, nor to be ſubjected to as ſuch by congregations, but to be withdrawn from: But here it is ſo; the Curates have entered on congregations, without this election and call of the people, their juſt right and priviledge. All the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat will be about the <hi>Antecedent</hi> of the <hi>firſt propoſition,</hi> which to us is clear from Scripture and pureſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as our orthodox Divines prove againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. All that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath to ſay to this, is the power of the Church to alter and change theſe and other things of the like nature; the very anſwer of our adverſaries: but how or from what this is made good, is not yet showne us: Antiquity is ſo clear and full in this, that it is a wonder, that they, who plead ſo much for prelacy from it, can be able to caſt it here: it the Prelacy, controverted among us, had but half of the evidence from Antiquitie, that the peoples right and power of election hath; it had gon far to have determined the queſtion in its behalf, with ſome that yet ſtand aloofe from it: this shews, it is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:39286:61"/>not the evidence or inevidence of arguments, that reſolves many, anent the debats of thoſe times; but intereſt and luſt that ſweys them more, then the love of truth. But more of this afterwards.</p>

Hearing of, ſubmiting to, &amp; receiving of ordinances from the Curates alone, and not from others, is enjoyned by law, and required as the ſigne of our compliance with, and ſubjecting to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lawes, bringing in and eſtablishing of Prelacy, with other corruptions, which we dare not owne. Hearing, and receiving ordinances from ſuch, hath a twofold bar put upon it to us; an unqualified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or object; and the reſpect that by the law it is made to have to the corruptions obtruded upon this Church, as the ſigne of our compliance with and ſubjection to theſe. The command of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout hearing, does conſtitut the object and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (what and whom) we should hear: As we are not to hear all doctrines, but theſe that are ſound; ſo we are not to hear and receive all, that pretend to come in Chriſts name, but theſe, of whoſe miſſion we have ſome rational evidence; at leaſt againſt which, we have no juſt exceptions. This, as to the Curats, is made out by the former arguments. But beſides this, the ſigne appointed and determined by the law, and required of all in this Church, is that they not only withdraw from, and do not hear the ejected and non-conforme Miniſters; but that they hear and ſubmit to Miniſters, that comply with and enter into this Church, by the Prelates: which to us makes hearing and receiving of ordinances from them, a practical approbation of, and compliance with Prelacy, and other corruptions, contained in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39286:62"/>the law: for ſuch is the connection between the ſigne and the thing ſignified, that he that yeelds to give the ſigne, doth in all rational conſtruction approve the thing ſignified. <hi>Obj.</hi> But hearing and receiving is a duty commanded by God, which being ſo, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe to be ſuch by the Magiſtrats command en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning it? <hi>Anſ.</hi> In this anſwer our Opponents do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly triumph; but to unfold its vanity and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in this mater, let it be conſidered.
1. That Gods law in conſtituting of duty does not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the act, but the objects and inſtruments, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and by which, they are to be exerciſed, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they are not duty, nor acts of obedience to God, ſo that is not the act ſimply, that is made a duty, but in its reſpect to ſuch and ſuch objects and inſtruments: as for inſtance, praying is a duty, not ſimply in it ſelf conſidered; but in its reſpect to God in his ſon Chriſt Jeſus, for ſuch and ſuch things, he commands and allows in his word; ſo it is in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whoſe object and inſtrument muſt be ſuch as is appointed in the word, other ways it is not duty, but in many caſes, a pofitive ſin; for the commands of God about hearing, do reſtrict it, in its objects and inſtruments, without which, it is not duty; ſo that we muſt carefully ſee, what it is we hear, and whom. Let our adverſaries firſt anſwer our former arguments, and prove that they are thoſe, whom by the commands of God we are appointed to hear; and we shall yeeld.2. The thing commanded by the Magiſtrat, in this caſe and mater, is not a duty; let them prove it that aſſert this. We grant, hearing of the Goſpel, and receiving of the ordinances, is dury; but only as it ſuppons and takes in lawfully
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:39286:62"/>called and ſent Miniſtery (known to be ſuch,) to whom the diſpenſation of the word is commited: none will ſay, it is a duty to hear the word and receive ordinances from thoſe, that are not ſent, or have no juſt authority to diſpenſe the ſame: the Magiſtrats commands in his preſent laws, reſtricts hearing of the word, &amp; receiving of ordinances to ſuch &amp; ſuch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting theſe as to others; which commands not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the due inſtruments appointed by God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty, do not enjoyn a duty but a ſin. <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. If the Prelats &amp; their Curats be Miniſters of the Goſpel; then they are to be heard, &amp; ordinances should be received from them; for the Miniſterial power gives to the perſons inveſted therewith, not only a right to preach the word &amp; diſpenſe ordinances, &amp; maketh their acts valide; but it bind; them to the doing of theſe; and all others to ſubmit to them in the exerciſe of their power: as is apparent in all relations, &amp; the mutual duties, that the perſons under them owe to one another; ſo that if Miniſters be bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach the Goſpel, and diſpenſe its ordinances, the people muſt likewiſe be oblidged to hear and receive ordinances from them? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Albeit we should yeeld the Prelats and Curats to be Miniſters; to the denying of which, they have given and do give to many, too much ground, by their open avowed perjury, enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at and oppoſition to true godlineſs; their renunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt for their immediat Supream head, by ſubjecting themſelves to another foraigne Supream in the Church; and their wicked and flagitious lives) yet the conſequence will not hold: for.
1. The true ſtate of the queſtion is, whether we should receive &amp; ſubmit to them, as the lawfully called &amp; appropriat Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:39286:63"/>of this Church; which for the former and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent reaſons we deny: And we would gladly ſee how they will prove it, for although intruders upon the Church be Miniſters, yet their intruſion puts a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient bar on peoples reception of and ſubmiſſion to them; as we have made out both <hi>in theſi &amp; in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi:</hi> wherefore in ſo far, as hearing &amp; receiving of ordinances from Prelatical Miniſters, in our caſe, is an acknowledgment of this, we refuſe it.2.

We shall not here urge the judgment and practice of our worthy reformers anent the Romish Prieſts, Jeſuits, and others in orders, among them, who ſuſtained, the validity of ordinances diſpenſed by ſuch; and yet held, that they should not be heard, nor ordinances received from them.

It is of no little weight to us, when added to the former, that the generality of theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently thruſt-in on congregations, are either inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient or ſcandalous; (creatures we confeſs fitted for carrying on of the Prelats deſignes, againſt this Church and us) by whom the poor people were, and yet are in hazard, throw Ignorance, Piophannes, Atheiſme, and a Spirit of deluſion, abounding in all corners of this Land: who, in ſtead of preventing and cureing of the ſame, do rather further and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance theſe Church-deſtroying evils; as we do not make perſonal ſcandal, of it ſelf, a ſufficient ground of withdrawing from ordinances, diſpenſed by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, guilty thereof; yet when theſe are found in the carriage of thoſe, whoſe entry is corrupt, and ſuch as cannot be juſtifyed, we cannot but think ourſelves under ſtraiter tyes to be ware of, and fly from ſuch: partly becauſe of the little or no ground we have to expect any ſpiritual advantage from their adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy things: and partly for the precepts we find in the word for avoiding and shuning of ſuch <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. with many others.

Beſides theſe there were ſeveral things, in the ſtated caſe of the time, and the circumſtances of it, that withheld, and yet withhold us, from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting to the prelates and their curates; which we wish were laid to heart by all as they are concerned.
As 1. For making way to the introduction of prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the very foundations of civil government were shaken and unhinged, by the diſannullig and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinding of ſuch a ſeries of Parliaments, for many years, in the moſt of which, there were, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ancient cuſtomes and lawes, all that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, is held and reputed eſſential to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Parliaments. By this deed not only the Conſtitution of former Parliaments are ſtruck at; but (as is to be ſeen in the reaſons given for it, in the <hi>act reſciſſorie</hi>) a preparative is made, for the changing of the Government, by any that, in after ages, have a minde for, and power to effect it. Although the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> at that time, was as highly prelatical, and as much made for the Kings deſignes, as ours; yet they forbore ſuch a deed, anent the Long-lived-Parliament, albeit they had the ſame reaſons and grounds for it, that we pretended.2. This change made in the Church, was accompanied, and yet is, with ſuch a ſpeat of enimity at, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to true godlines, in its neceſſare exerciſes; that the perſons that ſavoured any thing of Religion, ſobriety and conſcience, came under a cloud, and were diſcountenanced, even from the higheſt to the loweſt, as perſons not fit to be intruſted in any place of office or power: while theſe that were known to be of diſſolute lives, and given to all ſorts of wickednes,

If it were not for too much prolixity, this might be made to appear from a multitude of undenyable, but lamentable inſtances; which for brevities ſake we forbear, not loveing to ſtir in this filthy puddle.3. As to the Government of the Church in particular, the caſe was wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, from that of our worthie Predeceſſors, in the former Prelats time: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, as prelacy was then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly brought in upon them, by degrees, and not all at once; ſo they continued in the poſſeſſion of the Government of the Church, that had been ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>led by law, and never legally or actually diſinabled to meet, and exerciſe the ſame, in their fixed and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare judicatories: but continuing as formerly in Presbyterated meetings, had the Prelats thruſt in upon them; as is evident from hiſtory, even of <hi>Spotiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;</hi> But in our caſe, Prelacy is at the firſt raiſed by law to its greateſt height; Presbytery diſcharged, cashiered and ejected out of this Church; all lawes for it, either in late or former times, being diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abrogated; the meetings of Miniſters in their fixed Presbyterial and Synodical aſſemblies inhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under ſevere penalties by acts of Councel, which became ſo univerſally obeyed, that Presbytery had neither a legal nor actual being, in the time that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy was erected &amp; brought in upon this Church: So that at its actual introduction, we were, conforme to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:39286:65"/>Lawes, required to come in, ſubmit to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the government ſetled by them, which was purely Prelatical and <hi>Erdſtiuml;an.</hi> They that deny this muſt contradict the law, and make the law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers liars. if the laws and actings conforme thereto have any ſenſe, that may be rationallie deduced the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refrom. Hence, what was required was directly contrare to our principles &amp; known judgment, which to this day, we never ſaw any convincing reaſons, to make us relinquish, Here we cannot, but complean of the palpable injuſtice, done us by the Author of the <hi>ſeaſonable caſe</hi> (falsly ſo called) who contrare to all evidence, makes the caſe now and then alike. But notorious lies and untruths muſt be made uſe of to fill up the roome of truth, ſo shamefully deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that party.4. The government of the Church that then was, was by law totally ſubverted, and Prelacy brought in its place, at and by the meer authority of the King; the government thereof by a preceeding law or act being wholly put into his hands, (the authority of Parliament interpoſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for the eſtablishing of prelacy, being by this only corrobovative and precarious;) as if it were only of his frameing and making, and had no higher derivation, but that of humane authority; which we look upon, as an high derogation of the Regal and Supream authority of Chriſt Jeſus, the alone Head and King of his Church; and a dreadfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in changing the laws and ordinances, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and inſtituted by Him in his houſe; which all Chriſtians, eſpecially Proteſtants, eſteem ſacred and inviolable. Can we, according to the principles we have received and drunk in, from the word of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:39286:65"/>the liveing God, allow of this forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this way introduced into the Church? Thoſe that love eaſe, and things of this world, may think light of all; but it is not ſo to us, who are, through grace, reſolved to owne no other Head of that body, (then Chriſt Jeſus) of whom we profeſſe ourſelves members. The recent and fresh memory of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Solemne League and Covenants; under the tye of which this Nation and Church came ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then once; all rankes and degrees of perſons, Noble and Ignoble, from the Kings Majeſty to the loweſt Subject, being ſolemnly engadged thereby againſt the evils and corruptions ejected by them. The obligation of which had been enforced, and legally ſecured by a continued ſeries of lawes and practiſes, for a long time, that ſeemed to promiſe all imaginable ſecuritie, to the work of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againſt the out moſt aſſaults of its adverſaries: nothing was left undone, that could be attempted by rational men in this caſe. While all theſe things were in being, and recent in the memory of all, at home and abroad, at one dash, in ſo little a time, to raze to the foundations, all the former, ſuperſtructure, and build up the contrare; and that by perſons, who, (for their generality) had been ſo active for, and ſo deeply engadged in former proceedings, is ſtrange to think on; eſpecially conſidering the verbal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and engagments made unto us, immediatly before this change.

If they judge hearing of us unlawful; they muſt either ſay that our Miniſters are no Miniſters; or els that Miniſters may be withdrawn from and not heard, although they be Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus: and conſequently it will follow from their own opinion, and practice anent us, that there are ſome things for hearing and receiving of ordinances, from any perſon, beſide there being Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt: Or els the charge of ſchiſme, and ſeparation, will fall as heavy on themſelves, for not hearing and receiving of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:39286:67"/>from our Miniſters, as on us. But enough of this. Whoever reads that manuſcript, will find it ſufficiently anſwered in this short touch, for all his argueings are againſt his owne shadow, and miſſe the mark he should shoot at.</p>
                  <p>To shut up this wearyſome and unpleaſant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; In the laſt place, we are charged with all the profanity, wickedneſs and enormous practices, that are commited, and do, ſince the erection of Prelacy, abound in the Land: yea our meetings for worship, (now branded with the anciently odious name of <hi>Conventicles,</hi> with which aſſemblies of Chriſtians in the primitive times were noted, and deſigned by their perſecutours) are given out and repreſented to the world, as the cauſe inductive to theſe horrid &amp; abominable ſcandals, which are boldly aſſerted to be acted &amp; commited at them, in a paper of greivances, given in from the Dioceſan Synod of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> in Prelat <hi>Lightons</hi> time, and preſented to the then Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lawderdal,</hi> and the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable privy Councel, by the <hi>parſon</hi> of <hi>Glaſgow, Mr. Arthur Roſſe,</hi> and now Prelat of <hi>Argile,</hi> that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and viperous Calumniator, who, from the pulpit, &amp; other places, uſeth to father all the ſcandals of the time, on our party and their meeting? <hi>Anſ.</hi> paſſing that Prelats malicious and venemous railings againſt us, (as not worthy of our notice) whoſe not-our and manifeſt lies, his bitter invictives, and ill grounded aſſertions; (which not only ſpeaks his heart and tongue to be ſet on fire of hell, but renders him diſtiked and odious to many of his owne party) we ſay.
1. From whence came that fearful deluge of all ſorts of profanity and wickedneſs, that filled the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:39286:67"/>before, at, &amp; after the laſt erection of Prelacy, and for a conſiderable time, when there were few or no Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles? We have not forgetten (and we hope, the ſober and humble, that mourne for the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions done in the midſt of us, will not) with what a Spirit of impietie Prelacy entered into this Church, and followed it, for a long time: could our meetings for worship (called <hi>Conventicles</hi>) be the cauſe of theſe, when they were not, and had not a being?2. We beg of our oppoſites, that they will aſſigne us the cauſe of the open reigning ſcandals, found in them that follow not our meetings, but keep and adhere to theirs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the places, where there are no Conventicles, but an univerſal ſubjection to Prelacy? That there are ſuch impieties reigning without any control, in theſe parts, is paſt all denyal? And what will our adverſaries give for the cauſe of theſe? Surely they cannot, with any shew of reaſon, Father them on our meetings.3. Is it not obſerveable, yea obſerved by all, that, in places drowned in ignorance, ſin and wickedneſs, where Conventicles have come, and at this day are in uſe, a ſenſible reformation in perſons and families hath enſued thereon, and that to the reſtraining of theſe ſcandalous impieties, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in theſe bounds before, and the shameing of theſe that yet live in them: can that be the cauſe of ſcandals, that in experience, is alwayes found to be the effectual means of reſtraining and removing of them?4. While we caſt our eyes about us, to diſcover the grounds, on which they fix this greivous and heavy charge, it does not appear to us, ſo much as to give the leaſt degree of probability to it; yea, the evidence of the contrare is ſo clear and full, that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:39286:68"/>we cannot think, our adverſaries do beleeve themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in theſe and other reproaches, they load us with. Sure we are, they cannot binde this charge on the doctrines we profeſſe, and are preached in our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are contained in our printed Confeſſions of faith, long ſince emited to the world, eſpecially in the Confeſſion of faith, the large and shorter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmes, compoſed by the Aſſembly of divines at <hi>Weſt Minſter.</hi> We earneſtly beg of our Antagoniſts, that they will give inſtances, in any of theſe doctrines, (if they can) that of themſelves do tend to licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and profanity? Upon a review of the whole of our doctrine, in its ſeveral parts, we cannot pitch upon one, except the doctrine of juſtification by faith only, throw the alone merits and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, maintained by all proteſtants, except ſome, who of late do aſſert the intereſt of good works, as a preexiſtent condition of a ſinners juſtification before God, which yet is not directly and poſitively done, but by indirect wayes and hints, as is to be ſeen in Mr <hi>Gilbert Burnets</hi> firſt dialogues, <hi>Patrick the Pilgrim,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>whole duty of Man,</hi> who reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve a ſinners juſtification before God, in his ſerious purpoſe and endeavour of good works, at leaſt, as a preexiſtent condition of it: which is not only againſt the doctrine of all proteſtants till of late (as is to be ſeen in their writings) but directly againſt the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians;</hi> whoſe arguments in that mater, when our adverſaries have anſwered them, we ſhall conſider at more length. All the reaſons they give for this charge, from the head, are ſo fully anſwered by that Apoſtle in the6. <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:39286:68"/>and 2. to the <hi>Galatians</hi> towards the cloſe, that we judge it needleſſe to inſiſt any further on this. We do not charge all of the Prelatical party with this corrupt doctrine; ſome of them, particularly doctor <hi>Tully,</hi> hath ſo clearly and ſoundly aſſerted and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat the doctrine of Proteſtants in this mater, againſt the exceptions and arguments of the contrare minded, that he if living deſerves thanks from all the Proteſtant Churches of Chriſt, in this and other parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world: A doctrine that hath been eſteemed funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall among them, and given as one great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick betwixt us and Papiſts; yea, it hath been looked upon as the note and ſigne of the <hi>reſurgentis aut cadentis eccleſiae,</hi> as she holds to or departs from the ſame. We are not ſo antiprelatical, as not to love truth, wherever we find it, and the aſſertor thereof for its ſake, although differing from us, in ſome other things.5. It is thought ſufficient ground for this charge, that ſome, yea many of the perſons that come to and haunt our meetings, are found not to be conſcientious and Chriſtian in their walk, but flagitious or, in many of their practiſes, ſcandalous? We cannot think our adverſaries are ſerious in this, &amp; do beleeve as they ſpeak, ſeing.
(1) This does fall as heavy, and will, to onlookers, reflect as much, and more, on the objectors themſelves, as on us; whoſe meetings for worship are found to be the ſinck of all debauched and profaine perſons thorow the Land; can they refuſe this? It is like, the foreſight of this forced them to ſay, in their lybel of greivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt us, that the abominations mentioned in one Article, were commited at our meetings, and not by perſons preſent at them; otherwiſe their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies

The Lord deliver us from, and rebuke the lying Spirit, that is entered into and poſſeſſeth many.(2.) But if the preſence of wicked and ſcandalous perſons, at the aſſemblies of Chriſtians for hearing of the word, and performing of other acts of worship, be ſufficient ground for chargeing the wickedneſſe and impieties of ſuch on them, as the cauſe inductive to ſcandals; will not the aſſemblies, that Chriſt, his Apoſtles, Miniſters and Chriſtians keeped in all ages, be as lyable to this charge, as we, who excluded none, but admited all to the hearing of the word, and ſome other acts of worship, as is manifeſt from Scripture and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory? whatever our adverſaries will ſay for clearing of. Chriſt Ieſus, his Apoſtles, &amp;c. will acquit us.(3.) Do not men know, that in preaching of the Goſpel to ſinners, we should deſigne and labour their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as much as the edification of the converted? Is not the Goſpel, with which Miniſters are intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the mean and power of God to the one, as well as to the other? And ſeing this is our deſigne, as it hath been our practice, ſo it is our reſolution, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any from our aſſemblies, how wicked ſoever they have been, or are: Truth is, to charge us and our meetings, with the ſinnes and ſcandals of thoſe that frequent the ſame, is to reproach the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to Father all the wickedneſſe of its hearers on it, contrare to its grand deſigne, which is to ſave

We look upon it, as an unjuſt ſtate of the queſtion, in this mater, which hath been offered by ſome: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Magiſtrat, <hi>jure,</hi> may, or have it within the compaſs of his Magiſtratical power, to give liberty, to Miniſters and people, for ſerving and worshiping of God in his Son Chriſt Ieſus, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his word; this we do not deny, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully grant, that although the exerciſe of Church po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that is properly ſuch, be independent on the Magiſtrat; yet the peacable exerciſe of it is truely from him: it belongs to him, no doubt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,

Neither is it with us a queſtion, whether the Magiſtrat may command Miniſters to the duties of then function; nor whether he may exeem them from the hazard of ſuffering, to which they are obnoxious by law, for their non-conformity; nor yet whether he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Miniſters, ſimply and abſtractedly conſidered from our preſent caſe (which is only proper to the Magiſtrat, and not all to the Church.) All theſe and much more we yeeld to the Magiſtrat, about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones and maters Eccleſiaſtical, according to the Word.

                     <hi>Aſſertion Firſt,</hi> The Magiſtrat, by vertue of his Magiſtratical power, cannot of himſelf and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, aſſigne or ſend Miniſters to particular congregations, to take the paſtoral charge and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of them. For
1. We finde not in all the Word
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:39286:70"/>of God, any ſuch power, given to, or exerciſed by the Magiſtrat, in the Church: none hath yet given any inſtances of this: If there be, let them be produced, and we shall acquieſce. All acknowledge the Church not to be founded on the law of nature, but on poſitive inſtitution, and ſupernatural revelation; and therfore not to be governed in wayes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Mens invention, but in theſe that are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Scriptures; without which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Church; ſo that she owning her being, conſtitution, and all to them; there muſt be ſome evident proof produced from theſe, before we can yeeld to any ſuch power in the Magiſtrat: how long shall we exſpect this:(2.) Alſo, we finde the Church in the poſſeſſion and exerciſe of this power, from the times of the Apoſtles, to the breaking up of the reformation by <hi>Luther,</hi> and others in <hi>Germany:</hi> as is manifeſt from Scripture and Hiſtory. We grant, there was for ſome time, a conſiderable debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> about the inveſtiture of Bishops; which gave the riſe to other Princes claming of the ſame, &amp; ſeaſing upon it: but what ſays this to the miſſion of Miniſters, &amp; application of their Miniſtery to particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? For as Prelacy was the invention of men, and the cauſe of horrid contentions in Churches and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes; ſo neither it, nor the practices occaſioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, can be any regulating precedent for us: beſides, in all theſe conteſts about inveſtiturs, betwixt the Pope and Princes, the miſſion of Miniſters was never queſtioned, but alwayes acknowledged, as proper to the Church, and not to the Magiſtrat, which will be clear to any that will be at paines to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:39286:71"/>read Church Hiſtory.(3.) The ſending of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to particular congregations, is an act of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, purly and formally Eccleſiaſtical, and not Civil; and therefore incompetent to the Magiſtrat: Let any conſider it, in its cauſes, mater, object and ends, and they shall finde it ſo: for the perſons ſent are Miniſters; the work they are ſent on, is to preach the Goſpel and diſpenſe its ordinances; theſe they are ſent to, are the Churches of Chriſt; the end for which they are ſent to ſuch, is to gather in and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the body of Chriſt; this is <hi>finis operis.</hi> We know of nothing that can beſaid againſt this; But that it is not purely Eccleſiaſtick in the efficient cauſe? <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this we reply, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all uſe in morals to ſuſtaine the validity of the Arguments, taken from the nature of the act, to the undueneſs of it to ſuch, and ſuch cauſes: for it is by the reſpect of ſuch acts in morals, to their mater, objects and ends, that the bounds are determined, and ſet to them in their effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſes; for inſtance, if the mater, object &amp; ends of an act be properly civil, it is granted by all, to be undue or incompetent to a Miniſter of the Goſpel, &amp; ſo of other acts, in their moral ſpecifical diſtinction, by which, in the law of God, they are aſſigned &amp; made due to ſuch and ſuch efficients. But <hi>Next,</hi> Upon this reaſon, it shall be as lawful for the Magiſtrat to ordaine, and ſend perſons without ordination, to preach the Goſpel, which is every way abſurd.(4.) The ſending of Miniſters to preach the Goſpel, and to overſee Churches is an act of the poteſtative miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (one part of the keyes of the kingdom of God) granted by Chriſt to his Church, and never to the Magiſtrat: from no part of the word can it be made
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:39286:71"/>appear, that Chriſt hath given this power to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat; we finde it given to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16:19. with ſeveral other places of Scripture: But, as to the Magiſtrat there is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſilentium.</hi> But that this ſending of Miniſters, is an act of poteſtative miſſion, we hope will not readily be denied: of any do; we ask, whether Miniſters go to ſuch congregations, on a ſpecial delegation from Chriſt, more then to others? If they do, then it muſt flow from this power of miſt on in the Church; If they go not, on this ſpecial delegation, then they run unſent, and are not the Paſtours of theſe flocks, more then of others; and conſequently they have no obligations upon them to feed theſe, more then any other congregation: which is abſurd. For, beſide the power of preaching and diſpenſing of ordinances, there is alwayes a ſpecial delegation of the perſon, to ſuch and ſuch a people, by which he becometh the Ambaſſadour &amp; meſſenger of Chriſt Jeſus, whom they are bound to hear and ſubmit to, as ſuch.(5.) This act of ſending Miniſters to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, ſuppons ſeveral things, that are beyond the line and cognition of the Magiſtrat, as ſuch; as the trial of Miniſters gifts; the knowledge of the ſpiritual State of the congregation; the ſutablneſs or unſurablneſs of Miniſters gifts to ſuch and ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ability to judge and cognoſce in theſe, as the mater and ends of this work require; with many other things, which not being granted to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat as ſuch, the work, to which theſe are neceſſarily requiſite, cannot belong to him: for every work, to which God calls any, hath its proper furniture of gifts and abilities, without which, none is to look
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:39286:72"/>upon themſelves as called thereto.(6.) Some of the great Patrons and zealous Promoters of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats power in this, and other things belonging to the Church, yeeld, that this power is in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the Church, when the Magiſtrat is either heathenish or heretical, as <hi>Vedelius;</hi> yea all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to grant it. How rational this is, and how conſiſtent with their arguments (the force of which is thereby utterly broken). let any judge: we ask, when this power is granted to be in the Church, whether it comes from Chriſt Ieſus, or the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat? (For a derive power it muſt be:) It cannot be from the Magiſtrat, who does not willingly part with any of his power; neither does religion robe the Magiſtrat of his power, nor depoſe him from his regality, and the prerogative thereof; as Proteſtants maintaine againſt the Papiſts: if it be derived and come from Chriſt (as it does) we deſire to know, what way it is conveyed to her, in this caſe, and not in the other, when the Magiſtrat is Chriſtian? As we finde no difference of caſes anent this mater given in the word; ſo we finde the ſame inſtitutions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and examples therein, by which the Church is impowered and oblidged, to exerciſe this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without the Magiſtrat, to continue, not only without any reſtrictions to times &amp; caſes, but without any repail. We hear nothing from our adverſaries, to anſwer this, but <hi>ineptia,</hi> foolish rovings. The truth is, their Arguments conclude, with as great force, againſt all power of government in the Church, under perſecuting Magiſtrats, as Chriſtian: for is there not in this caſe the erecting of an Empire in an Empire, which our enemies accoundt <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:39286:72"/>anddo not Miniſters, and Chriſtians, owe as much ſubjection to the Magiſtrat, in the one caſe, as in the other?</p>

                     <hi>Aſſertion</hi> 2. That the right and power of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and calling of Miniſters to particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is in the congregations themſelves, to whom they are ſent, by divine right; and not in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat: and therefore should not have been aſſumed by the Magiſtrat, and taken thus from them. That this power of election of Miniſters, is not in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat, either by divine, humane or Eccleſiaſtical laws, needs not to be much inſiſted on, ſeing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and antiquity, for a thouſand years after Chriſt, gives not the leaſt ground for it. We deſire to know from our Antagoniſts, <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> from whence came this power; or who were the givers of it to the Magiſtrat? When they have condeſcended on the orginal derivation of this power, and made it out to be juſt, then we shall conſider it; which by none of theſe parties hath been yet done; except by <hi>Vedelius:</hi> but on ſuch grounds, as give every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular member of the Church as good clame thereto, as he; as will be evident to any that conſiders his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: for Scripture and antiquity they have none. The firſt part of the propoſition, is that which is moſt ſtuck at; The peoples right and power of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is denyed by our adverſaries: but we thus make it out, as our Divines have done before us.

Our Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is, becauſe we finde in this queſtion, as it is ſtated betwixt us and the adverſaries, antiquity full and clear, which it is not in the other: Let the State of the queſtion about Prelacy, as it is now agitated betwixt us, be in every part of it, brought to the pure times of antiquity; and if it can be evidenced &amp; made out, even as to the ſole power of ordination &amp; juriſdiction, and ſuperiority of ſome Miniſters over other Miniſters of the Goſpel; and we shall yeeld the cauſe and quietly ſubmit: but in the buſineſs of the peoples right of election, it is beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction clear, even in the confeſſion of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts.(3) All relations amongſt rational creatures that are not founded on nature, &amp; are free, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

All other relations of this kinde are founded upon conſent; and why not this?(4.) The good effects that have come to the Church by the free and voluntar election of the people, where it hath been admited, and in uſe. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes us not alittle in this perſwaſion: we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeved in univerſal experience, that not only a more univerſal and chearful ſubjection hath been given to the Miniſtry of thoſe, that entered this way into congregations; but a faithful and able Miniſtry hath been more generally propagated, to the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of immortal ſouls: if we may gather the nature of the tree, by the fruit, we cannot ſay, this is evil; but truly good.</p>

(1.) We ſee no precept, inſtitution, and example in all the Scriptures, impowering the Magiſtrat to this: we hope, none will expect we should receive and ſubject to a power, that hath no warrant nor foundation in the word; ſeing all church power owes its deſcent and derivation from it: our Antagoniſts themſelves grant, that not only the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer they aſcribe to the Magiſtrat, is in and from the Scriptures; but the regulation of its exerciſe,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:39286:74"/>should be conforme thereto; ſo that there will be no debat about the conſequence. The great Patrons of <hi>Eraſtianiſme</hi> plead the inſtances of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> ordering the courſes of the <hi>Levits</hi> and the prieſts, and of other things relating to the worship of God, in the time of the old Teſtament; but to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: ſeing they acted therein as Prophets, and at the directions and inſtructions given from God, by the Prophets; and not as Magiſtrats; as is clear from the very letter of the Scriptures, in many places, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29: verſ. 25. and 35: verſ. 15. with others: If the Magiſtrats of our time, did produce ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for what they aſſume to themſelves, and do in this mater, how readily should they be obeyed? But the <hi>Objection</hi> of greateſt ſeeming ſtrength, is that of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zekias</hi> practiſe, keeping of the paſſeover in the ſecond moneth 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30, 2. which conforme to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>Exod.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our <hi>Anſ.</hi> to this is, <hi>firſt,</hi> if this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe be pleaded for a leading example to Magiſtrats; it will warrant Magiſtrats to change things inſtitute by God, which, we hope, all will ſay is abſurd. <hi>Obj.</hi> It was but the circumſtance of time that he changed? <hi>Anſ.</hi> a command or inſtitution makes circumſtances, determined by it, as unalterable by men, as the ſubſtantials of the ordinance it ſelf: does not this, if it be concludent, impower the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat to change our Sabboth, from the firſt to the ſecond, or any other day in the week, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? What may not come in at this dore? <hi>Next,</hi> Our ſatiſfying Anſwer to this is, that what <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the Princes &amp; Congregation did, they did it, at or by the word of the Lord concerning this alteration, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:39286:74"/>not of themſelves, as is expreſs vers 12.(2.) As it is uſual for commiſſions given to Ambaſſadors, by thoſe that ſend them, to containe all neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, for regulating their carriage, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their ambaſſage; ſo we finde in the Word of God rules, precepts and directions, given to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, about the ordering of the worship of God, and the exerciſe of their Miniſtery in all its parts; which not only impowers them for this work, but brings them under as ſtrait Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to obſerve the ſame, as the work and maine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of the ambaſſage, on which they are ſent: for this let 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. two Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> with other Scripturs be conſulted; and we doubt not but this will be beyond diſput with the unprejudged. If the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> could give us ſuch commands and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in the word, for the Magiſtrat power in this, how would they triumph, and ſo they juſtly might; for they should have no ſuch willing and cheirful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters to them then we; if any ſuch thing could be shewed.(3.) This power in the Magiſtrat would ſubject Miniſters to and bring them, in the exerciſe of their miniſterie, in a dependance on him; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare of which we have proved before, and shall do more after wards: The truth is, we tremble to think on the conſequences of this dependance, for thereby the Magiſtrat may ſuſpend the miniſtry, in theſe parts and exerciſes of it, that Chriſt Jeſus cals them to, in the ſtated caſes of the times, in which they live; as for inſtance, when hereſies are abounding, and Profeſſors taken with the infection of that leaven, he may put them on the preaching of doctrines not appoſite to the preſent caſe, and diſcharge them from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:39286:75"/>medling with doctrines contrare to the preſent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; as our Magiſtrats have done anent ſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in theſe times: he may likewiſe forbid them preaching againſt, or cenſuring of theſe ſinnes that are reigning in the place and time, in obeying of which, Miniſters shall croſs the commands of Chriſt to them in his word, and bring themſelves under the guilt of the blood of ſoules. If Churches and Miniſters be not, in the commands, precepts, and inſtitutions of God, exeemed from the power and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of men, what a ſad caſe will they be in?(4.) The Church had and exerciſed this power from Scripture times in all ages, till within theſe hundereth years. We grant the Magiſtrat exerciſed a power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, or anent the Church; but never came this length: when they did reforme, &amp; gave any redreſs of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, creept into the adminiſtrations of holy things, they did it by the Church; whom, in her officers, they did convocat, and require to conſider the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to make conſtitutions about it; but never eſſayed to do it immediatly, and by themſelves; as Church Hiſtories make evident, beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.(5.) It is the natural right of all moral power, to order and diſpoſe its owne exerciſe, in and about the Maters that are proper to it; as might be made to appear by inſtances of theſe of the Parental, Marital Powers, &amp;c and the reaſon is, partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the objects and other circumſtances are ſo many and various; that it is not poſſible to preſcribe rules, comprehenſive of all particular emergents, relating to their excerciſe, but muſt be leſt to the prudence of thoſe inveſted with them, to do therein, as they ſee fit and expedient, in the caſes that are before them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:39286:75"/>and partly ſuch are fiteſt, as having more knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge and experience about ſuch things, that belongs to their power, then any others. We ſee this yeelded to others, and why then not to Miniſters, who may, in rational judgment, be preſumed, to have more ſolide knowledge and experience, in and about the maters of God, as any?(6.) All divines (except thoſe called <hi>Eraſtian,</hi> who are but of a late edition in the Church) yea the Prelatical ones, doe grant a <hi>diatactik</hi> power to the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, about the worship and government of the Church, and the exerciſe of their Miniſtry relating thereto: and till ERASTUS the phiſtrian aroſe, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond controverſie among all Church writers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtorical or Polemick; even thoſe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Magiſtrats power, againſt the uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Popes;</hi> as is to be ſeen in their Tractats; from which we might adduce citations not a few; but fearing they wold prove too tedions, if inſetted here, We forbeare.</p>

For the act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence confines the Miniſters of the whole party: if it had been but ſome few, that this confinment reach'd, we would not have ſaid much to it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſentence had been unjuſt. But while we
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39286:76"/>conſidered the preſent univerſal neceſſity of the Church, and the obligations on us, to uſe our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, for anſwering the ſame, we could not, with quietneſs to our conſciences juſtifie nor allow of it as a favour, with ſuch a reſtraint on our Miniſtry. If the confinment had only touched our perſons, and perſonal concerns, we had with all patience and ſubmiſſion yeelded thereto; but a reſtraint being put on the exerciſe of our Miniſtery, in this neceſſitous condition of the Church, when <hi>Papiſts, Quakers</hi> and other ſubverters of truth and godlineſs, do multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abound, without all crub, we could not cloſe with this indulgence; which, by vertue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finment, puts us out of capacitie, for affording that relief to the Church and immortal ſouls, which our office binds us to. (2.) As there are many duties and parts of our Miniſterial function, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe and exerciſe, but in a conjunction with others; ſo this indulgence cuts off from all acceſſe to the ſame, and leaves us in much worſe caſe, then we were in before. Have we not the Goſpel of Chriſt to maintaine againſt its preſent adverſaries? Are we not bound to propagat the ſame in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſucceeding ages? Do not ſcandals of all forts abound, to the overthrow of truth and piety? and does not the care and burdine of ſeeing to and providing againſt the evil, that in theſe times, thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aten the ruine of the Church, lye upon us in our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial capacity? And we cannot ſingly and apart, doe what is neceſſare in this caſe, but in a conjunction with one another: no doubt, our ſubjecting to this confinment would render us acceſſory to, and bring us under the guilt of all theſe evil and their conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:39286:76"/>to this, and the following generations. Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, no queſtion, should have all cauſe to curſe and charge their blood upon us, which is trembling to think upon. (3.) If we may gueſſe at, and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained of the ends and deſignes of mens actions, by the native effects and conſequences of them; it is to us apparent and beyond denyal, that the project and intention of this contrivance, was quietly to ruine and bury our cauſe; ſeing by this confinment, and other things in this <hi>indulgence,</hi> all endeavours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſucceſſion of a faithful miniſtery, are cut off, and we brought unto an immediat dependance on the Magiſtrat, in the maters of God, and hindered to propagat the truth, in oppoſition to its adverſaries, in other parts of the land; being thus shut up into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le corner of the ſame, &amp; caſt by two's &amp; three's and fours, into congregations; where, for the moſt part, there is little or no uſe for us; If the Apoſtles and other Miniſters of Chriſt, in Scripture times, had been thus dealt with, and in policy confined, as we are; do any think, they would have ſubmitted to, and obeyed ſuch a confinment, which would have fruſtrated the ends of their office and work; and made them guilty of diſobedience to their Maſter, from whom they received commands, inconſiſtent with ſuch a ſentence? And shall we ſubject and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentient to a deed, that in the deſigne and effects thereof will infallibly deſtroy the cauſe, which, by all ſorts of obligations, we are engadged to maintaine and advance to the utmoſt of our power? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. We are not ignorant, that the confinment, with a permiſſion to preach and exerciſe other parts of our miniſtry, in the places, to which we were to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:39286:77"/>be confined; was a piece of policy, invented to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the too viſible encroachment on Church power, in the firſt act of Indulgence (which was known af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſtumble many) that the mater might be more ſmoothed, and goe the better down; while the deſigne was the ſame; which was (as is ſaid) to bring our miniſtry in ſubjection to the Magiſtrat, in the maters of God; and without noiſe to obſtruct the ſpreading of the Goſpel, and to ruine our cauſe; for attaining of which, we have not yet ſeen a more ſuccesful like piece of policy, then this of the <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:39286:77"/>the former practice of the Lords ſervants and people, in preaching and hearing of the word; that hath been bleſſed, and made not a little ſuccesful, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the truth, and the benefite of many ſouls.(2.) Many by this indulgence were aſſigned and ſent to other congregations, then theſe they had formerly ſerved their Maſter in, before this revolution in the Church: As we judge the former relations to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular flocks (over which the Holy Ghoſt, and not the State, had made them overſeers) to be yet in force, and not diſſolved by all the violence uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; ſo we think our approbation of this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, would not only juſtify the unjuſt uſurpation, and violence in caſting them out; but likwiſe would have made void the former, and yet ſtanding relation to theſe reſpective congregations, in which we darre have no hand, but in the way Chriſt hath appointed, and was formerly uſed in this Church; ſeing it will, no queſtion, both ſtrengthen the Magiſtrat, in his unjuſt encroachments on the Government of the Church, and be a practical acknowledgement of him, in all he hath done in this mater.(3.) By one clauſe in the 2. <hi>act of indulgence,</hi> appeals are allowed and authorized from the indulged to the Prelats Courts; which does ſubject, and directly ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat them to theſe, in the exerciſe of government and diſcipline, which is known, to be contrare to our Covenanted and well grounded principles. The truth is, we look on this, with other particulars in that <hi>indulgence,</hi> as a device framed of purpoſe, for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe ends and intents upon us, which by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence hath been formerly deſigned againſt us, for eſtablishing of <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Eraſtianiſme.</hi>(4.) As
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:39286:78"/>ſome of the Rules are impracticable, ſo others of them do not a little reflect upon the practiſes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, recorded by the Evangeliſts, who preached in houſes and fields. If we underſtand our Chriſtian profeſſion aright, we muſt take ourſelves bound by many commands and precepts in the word of God, to imitat Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in their performances of the duties of Religion and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which are of purpoſe related in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs for this effect. Do we not find from theſe ſacred records, Chriſt and his Apoſtles preaching in houſes and fields, as occaſions offered, never declining to teach and inſtruct the people in theſe, as the preſent exigence required, although they had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of and acceſſe to the Synagogues, which is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, as to the places allowed for publict worship?

                  <p>Amongſt the many deſignes aimed at, in this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi> and in part obtained by it; we know the deviding and breaking of our party, was a principal one; which at firſt actuated, and ſet on foot this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice amongſt us; but, we hope, without the fruit our adverſaries exſpected to have reaped thereby, to the advantage of their cauſe: for, whatever diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there hath been, or yet is amongſt us, in our practice, in relation to the <hi>indulgence,</hi> we are all agreed in the preceeding exceptions againſt it; and if there had been acceſſe for repreſenting the ſame to our
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:39286:78"/>Rulers, our unanimity and concord in theſe had been more diſcovered, and made known to the world, then it is. There is no charge with us of our known and profeſſed judgment, about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, in its true diſtinction from: and independence on the Magiſtrat, as is afterward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. What ever was our perſwaſion in this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the world in our publick confeſſ on of faith, we yet, throw the grace of God, reſolve to cleave to: having never ſeen or heard of any thing, in all the times that have gone over our heads, to cauſe us alter our apprehenſions of this mater in the leaſt. Some (who take hold of all occaſions to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach us) are pleaſed to repreſent ſome their acceptance of this indulgence, as contradictory to, and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with our former profeſſed principles anent Church Government: yet any that conſiders what was shortly hinted at, to the Councel, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of this indulgence; and what was more lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely declared by them to the congregations, at their firſt entry, will be ſufficiently convinced of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant adherence to our former principles; which by this acceptance is not at all changed. It is expected from the lovers of our righteous cauſe, that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall be done by them, to ward the furtherance of the evil intents of this indulgence: but rather an endeavour to counteract and ineffectuat them, that our oppoſites may have no benefite therefrom, to the prejudice of the intereſts of Chriſt, for which we contend.</p>

Let none wonder, we take this ticklish ſubject into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and dar adventure, to give an accompt of our thoughts of the ſame, to the world: for we ſolemnly profeſſe, that on the exacteſt enquiry and ſearch, that we have been able to make about this mater; we finde it, as diametrically oppoſite to our true Covenanted principles, as Prelacy; and in its effects, we fear, shall prove as deſtructive to the Church, and work of Reformation, as any thing that appeared on the field againſt it: Times paſt and preſent ſpeak much to this, but the future will ſay more: the ſtorme, that this <hi>Supremacy</hi> threatens to this Church and nation, is ſuch, that it is the part of all that wish well to <hi>Zion</hi> to pray inflantly day and night, that it may be graciouſly averted. The truth is, as we look upon it, as an high corruption in it ſelf tending to the ſubverſion of the Churches concerns, in doctrine, worship, and Government; ſo it lies at the bottome of our non-conformity to the law, in Church maters; and is not only one, but a maine reaſon, why we
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:39286:79"/>cannot joyne in Church aſſemblies, eſpecially for Government; which thereby, in our apprehenſions, are made nullities. That our procedour in ſpeaking to this, may be diſtinct and clear to all, we shall obſerve this method.
1. We shall conſider &amp; ſpeak to the Government of the Church, and shew what it truly is.2. We shall prove its diſtinction from, &amp; independency on the civil Government. And3. Shew how far this Government of the Church is by law lodged in, and exerciſed by our Rulers, contrare to Scripture and the practice of the Church, till theſe hundered years paſt.</p>
                  <p>For more light to the whole, we shall premiſe theſe preliminary conſiderations or propoſitions, which, we think, will not readily be denied by any.
1. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> it is out of our rode, and inconſiſtent with our intended brevity, to inſiſt on the tearms <hi>GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT</hi> &amp; <hi>CHURCH,</hi> &amp; what is uſually ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by them; theſe we leave to the Criticks and all that write on this ſubject: but all are agreed in this, that <hi>GOVERNMENT</hi> is a tearme importing power and authority; which is nothing els, but a right to rule others; and an obligation on theſe inveſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to uſe the ſame, for attaining the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: So that Government makes its acts due &amp; bindes them to all theſe acts, means &amp; wayes, by which Government is enabled to reach its ends. 2. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> All created power &amp; authority is originall in God, as the &amp; firſt cheif cauſe thereof, &amp; derived from him, as the univerſal Supreme Monarch, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all in heaven or earth; hence it neceſſarly followes, that, as the power that cannot prove its
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:39286:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>deſcent from God, is not to be admited; ſo all juſt powers are directly ſubordinat to him as the univerſal head of all, 3. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> that the Church of Chriſt, not being founded in nature, but on ſupernatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, her Government muſt wholly depend upon &amp; flow from it, in theſe things where it differs from other Governments; ſo that the <hi>All</hi> of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is by poſitive inſtitution and warrant from God ſupernaturally revealed. 4. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> That Chriſt Jeſus, as Mediator, being made the head of the Church under God; and thereby her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fountained in him: all powers in the Church muſt be derived from, and ſubordinat to him, as the Supream. 5. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> Beſide the inviſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Government, that Chriſt Jeſus exerciſeth by his Spirit, on the ſouls and conſciences of his people, (that conſiſts in the inward light and power of his Spirit guiding and enabling them to that obedience, he requires of them in his word;) there is likwiſe a true viſible Government of the Church, inſtitute by him, and viſibly exerciſed in her, in his name, as her Supream. 6. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> The Government of the Church (as shall be proved afterwards) is not properly, and <hi>in linea directa</hi> ſubordinat to the Magiſtrat, for
1. It hath its derivation from another fountaine, Chriſt Jeſus; who being the Churches Supream head and governour, all power in her muſt come from and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him.2. The Magiſtrat cannot take away, nor change the Government of the Church, which he may do in Governments and powers ſubordinat to him: yea, he cannot impede its exerciſe, in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with it; ſeing they are under obligations for it, antecedent &amp; ſuperiour to theſe of the Magiſtrat. <pb n="133" facs="tcp:39286:80"/>7. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> That the holy Scriptures, being the word and law of Chriſt, as King of his Church, muſt be the inſtrument and rule of the Churches Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to which she ought to be ruled, not only in theſe acts of faith and obedience in the inner man, but alſo in the outward. 8. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> Although powers ſpecifically diſtinct be not ſubordinat to one another; yet there may be and is a mutual ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of perſons, inveſted with theſe powers, ſo as the perſons are in different reſpects ſuperiour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to one another; as <hi>Jeſſe</hi> was to <hi>David</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him to live in his ſon <hi>Davids</hi> reigne;) which ſubordination of perſons does not take away the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of theſe powers; nor the mutual ſubjection, the perſons owe to one another: hence we aſſert, that as Magiſtracy does not deſtroy the Miniſtry, nor looſe the perſons cloathed therewith, from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection they owe, as Chriſtians, to Miniſters, in the right exerciſe of their Miniſtery; ſo neither does the Miniſtery deſtroy Magiſtracy, nor untye Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as ſubjects, from that ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due to Magiſtrats from their ſubjects; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are bound to this as much as any. 9. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> As in all Governments, there are ſomethings that is intrinſick (although viſible) wherein its nature and ſpecifick eſſence does conſiſt, and ſomethings acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental and ſeparable from it, that belongs not to its <hi>eſſe,</hi> but <hi>BENE ESSE;</hi> ſo there are in the viſible Government of the Church, ſomethings eſſential &amp; intrinſick, (of which afterward) and ſomethings accidental and extrinſick, without which it can ſubſiſt, even in its exerciſe. 10. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> Theſe things, in and about which, the Government of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:39286:81"/>Church is converſant, are of diverſe ſorts; ſome are purely ſpiritual, as the Word, Miniſtery, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all Ordinances of divine appointment; Others are of a mixt nature, partly ſpiritual &amp; partly civil, as the neceſſary circumſtances and mods of worship and Government; which, although civil in their own nature, and common to other actions; yet partly by reaſon of the general divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, impowering the Church to diſpoſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe; partly by reaſon of their neceſſary conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with things purely ſpiritual, are truely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick, and become a part of the object of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power of Church Government, called by all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines <hi>DIATACTICK:</hi> Some are properly &amp; purely civil, in their owne nature and immediat ends; as Churches, Stipends, Manſes, Glybs, &amp;c. which, although they be by general precepts ſecured to the Church, and belonging to her; yet they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally civil, and come directly under the Magiſtrates power, as other civil rights and proprieties do, about which he does execute the judgment of truth &amp; peace. 11. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> It is to be adverted, that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſubordination of powers in Government; one <hi>in LINE A DIRECT A;</hi> and another <hi>in LINE A OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIQU A:</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> ſubordination, the power ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated is derived from, and comprehended in the Supream, and may be impeded, ſuſpended or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in its exerciſe, yea totally diſſolved by it; and when exerciſed, it is in the name and authority of the Supream, and wholly dependant, in its regulation, on it; ſo that both the power as ſuch, the perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted therewith, and its exerciſe, is ſubjected to the Supream. In the <hi>ſecond</hi> kind of ſubordination,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:39286:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſubordinated power, or rather the perſon in its exerciſe, is only the object of ſome acts of another power; but the power is not derived from it, nor <hi>JURE,</hi> impedible or regulable by it: It is in this laſt ſort of ſubordination, that Magiſtrats and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are ſubordinated to one another, without all ſubordination of the powers, in their exerciſe; for as Magiſtrats may, yea should command Miniſters, when negligent, to the duties of their function; ſo Miniſters ought, in Chriſts name, to command Chriſtian Magiſtrats to do the duties belonging to their office; and to rebuke them authoritatively, when found acting contrare thereto. 12. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> Theſe ſubjected to created powers, whether Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical or Miniſterial, being under the ſupream, abſolure and univerſal Soveraignity of God, have a power of judgment and diſcretion granted to them, for cognoſcing on the commands of their ſuperiours, as to their juſtice or injuſtice, or their conſiſtency with, or repugnancy to the commands of God; by which they are to walk in giving or not giving obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their ſuperiours.</p>
                  <p>The way being thus paved, our next work is, to shew, what we judge to be the Government of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, which we shall do in theſe Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Concluſ.</hi>
1. The Government of the viſible Church largely conſidered, is either Supream or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat: to the Supream belongs the legiſtative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as the making and enacting of lawes, inſtituting of ordinances, appointing and impowering of officers; and to be the fountaine of all power in the Church. This we aſſert to be only in Chriſt Jeſus; and viſible in his word, ordinances, officers, and the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:39286:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>conveyance of all Church power: in this, none share with him either Magiſtrats o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Miniſters. <hi>Concluſ.</hi>2. The ſubordinat power of Government in the Church, is in her officers, that Chriſt hath appointed and called thereto; which power, is only and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from Chriſt, and exerciſed in his name, over all in the Church, which diſtinction of Church Government makes not different Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the head and members; it being one and the ſame Government, truly Monarchical, not Ariſtocratical, nor Democratical. <hi>Concl.</hi>3. This derived and ſubordinat power in Church officers, when conſidered with reſpect to its mater, in and about which it is exerced, is diverſe: Schoolmen and Divines diſtinguish it, into the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> &amp; <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> but for explications ſake, and avoiding of all ambiguity, we shall conſider it, in the variety of its objects or mater; and its divers acts about the ſame.</p>
                  <p>As
(1.) To it belongs the diſpenſing of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of worship, in the publict aſſemblies of the Church, in preaching of the word, praying to (as the mouth of the aſſembly) and praiſing of God: in theſe they act, as the Authorized ſervants of Chriſt, in performing and directing of the worship of God in the Church.(2.) The convocating of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Church, for theſe divine and holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; on which all in the Church are bound by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts to attend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the inſtitute means of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, converſion, and edification.(3.)

                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 4. This Government of the Church,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:39286:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>as it is in the hands of Church officers, and exerciſed by them, is purely Miniſterial, without all dominion in them; and only <hi>executive</hi> in applying the will of Chriſt to the members of the Church, as they are found conform or diſconform to the ſame. <hi>Concl.</hi> 5. This ſubordinat power in Church officers is only <hi>declarative</hi> and <hi>nuncupative,</hi> and not properly <hi>deciſive;</hi> they have not power to determine what shall be true or falſe doctrine, ſin or duty; and what cenſure shall be inflicted on perſons heretical or ſcandalous; but only to declare and apply the will of Chriſt, and what he hath determined anent theſe in his word. This power ſuppons its object, and does not make it. <hi>Conel.</hi> 6. It is wholly limited, regulated by, and reſtricted to the word and law of Chriſt, as its baſis and rule, beyond which it cannot go; and if it do, its acts are nullities and not obligatory on any. <hi>Concl.</hi> 7. It is purely ſpiritual, in its mater, manner and ends; and not at all civil: it eſſentially reſpects the inner man, and wholly labours (in the wayes appointed) the ſaving, edifying and perfecting of it. <hi>Concl.</hi> 8. This power is not properly <hi>coercive, coactive,</hi> and <hi>compulſive;</hi> but only <hi>excluſive:</hi> that is, if it be not obeyed by them, about whom it is exerced it does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre them from, and deny them the benefits, that are offered to all, and promiſed to the obedient. <hi>Concl.</hi> 9. This power, in the hands of the Church officers, is truly Chriſts, and when acted in his name, conforme to his lawes, is the exerciſe of his Supream dominion in and over the Church; By which he truly and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioly reigns over all in her: ſo that obedience to this power, is obedience to Chriſt, as King of his Church; and the contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re is high rebellion againſt him. <hi>Concl.</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:39286:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>10. Although this power be only <hi>Miniſterial,</hi> and <hi>declarative</hi> of the will of Chriſt; yet it is <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and binding on all the Church, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of perſons; and that on a double account, <hi>firſt</hi> on the account of divine commands enjoyning ſubmiſſion and obedience to its exerciſe, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe inveſted therewith; and alſo on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its reſpect to, and derivation from Chriſt, whoſe power and ordinance it is; and whom, in its exerciſe, it doeth repreſent to all. <hi>Concl.</hi> 11. This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is exerciſed, either ſingly &amp; a part by every officer (according to the nature &amp; meaſure of their power;) or in conjunction with one another, conforme to the precepts of the word, and practiſes of the Church in Scripture times. Although every officer of the Church in their ſeveral orders, have the whole power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>intrinſice</hi> to it; yet there are ſome acts thereof, they cannot exerce, but in a conjunction with others, as ordaining of perſons for the Miniſtry, Trying and cenſuring of ſcandalous and heretical Profeſſours or Miniſters, &amp;c. for which there muſt be fixed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of officers, general and particular. <hi>Concl.</hi> 12. The ordiner officers of the Church (the extraordinar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> being ceaſed) are of three orders, Teachers and Paſtors; Ruling elders; and Deacons. Theſe we finde to be of divine inſtitution, and no others: Many others have been brought into, and obtruded on the Church, but all of humane, or rather of diabolical invention; as, alace, their effects have ſadly made out to the Church of God, in former and preſent times. In every one of theſe divine orders. we finde no inſtitute ſuperiority, in the ſame order, of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others; as a Paſtor of Paſtors; or an Elder
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:39286:84"/>of Elders; and a Deacon of Deacons: Theſe who have aſſumed and exerciſed this ſuperiority we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not owne, as the Officers of Chriſt, nor ſubject to them, as ſuch, till they prove their inſtitution and miſſion from him; which yet they have not done. The outmoſt eſſey hath been for <hi>Prelacy</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who is pleaded to be a Paſtour of Paſtours having the overſight of them and their flocks; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing attempted for making out the divine right of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats, Archbiſhops, Archpresbyters, Archdeacons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is that lowly and humble Government of the Church, that Chriſt hath inſtitute in his word, and put in the hands of his Officers, commanding them to exerciſe and diſpenſe the ſame to all in his houſe, under high paines: of which in the ſecond place we aſſert theſe two.
1. That it is diſtinct and ſpecifically different from the civil government of the Magiſtrat. And2. That it is independant on it. Theſe two concluſions we now undertake to prove, againſt the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> of our time, who aſſert, that when the Church comes to be embodyed with the Commonwealth, her Government becomes one with the Government of the State, and does not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from it.</p>
                  <p>In oppoſition to theſe, we <hi>affirme,</hi> that when a Nation, State or Kingdom turnes Chriſtian, in its Rulers and Subjects, the Government of the Church remaines ſpecifically different and diſtinct from the Government of that State or Kingdome; as it was before its converſion to Chriſtianity. The reaſons perſwading us of this, are 1. The Government of the Kingdome, that is not of this world, is diſtinct and different from the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:39286:84"/>that are of this world? But ſo it is, that the Government of the Church is the Government of a Kingdome, that is not of this world. Therefore the Government of the Church is diſtinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Government of the civil Magiſtrat, that is, the Government of Kingdomes that are of this world. This Argument leans on theſe three.
1. That the Church is a Kingdome,2. That she hath a Government; And3. That she is not of this world, although in it. All which are beyond diſput clear from the Scriptures. All that our adverſaries ſay to this, is, that the viſible Church of Chriſt, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but metaphorically called a Kingdome: But how evident is the contrare? for is not Chriſt Jeſus the Churches viſible Head and King? Is she not ruled by his viſible Lawes, Ordinances and Officers, that are properly and truely ſuch? and are not all theſe from above, and not of this world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum,</hi> 2. That Government whoſe ſupream Head, Lawes, Ordinances and Officers are ſpecifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from the Head, Lawes, Ordinances, and Officers of the civil Magiſtrat, muſt be diſtinct from it: But ſo it is that the head, lawes, ordinances and Officers of the Church are diſtinct from the lawes, &amp;c. of the civil Magiſtrat: Therefore, &amp;c. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>firſt propoſition</hi> is clear; for that which makes one Government differ from another, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent heads, lawes, Ordinances &amp; Officers: where theſe are either numerically or ſpecifically different, the Government is different accordingly: it being comprehended in all theſe: but that the ſupream head, laws, ordinances, and Officeis of the Church are ſpecifically different, from theſe of the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:39286:85"/>who will deny it, that profeſſes himſelf a Chriſtian? <hi>Obj.</hi> But all theſe come under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the Magiſtrat, when he turns Chriſtian. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Either theſe continue in the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Magiſtrats Government, what they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; or they do not: if they do, the Argument holds, and proves the Government of the Church, to be diſtinct from that of the Magiſtrats, when Chriſtian: If they do not continue, we aſk from whence come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this alteration, and how will they prove it? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here from our adverſaries, but <hi>Altum ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, or nugae,</hi> deſtitute of all reaſon. But, 2. The tearm <hi>INSPECTION,</hi> or <hi>OVERSIGHT,</hi> is am biguous; if by it we mean the countenancing, protecting, and encouraging of this Government of the Church, we yeeld <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t: but what ſayes that to the confounding of the Governments; or making the Government of the Church, the Magiſtrats: if by inſpection we underſtand, the devolving of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church on the Magiſtrat, as the fountaine of it; the ordering and diſpoſing of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, the changing thereof at pleaſure, in whole or in part: this we deny, and long have we looked for proofe; but have hitherto met with none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Government of the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly deliniated is incomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>table with the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats; therefore it is diſtinct from his Government. We hope, none will refuſe this conſequence. The <hi>antecedent</hi> is thus proven.
(1.) The ſubordinat Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church is purely <hi>Ministerial,</hi> not <hi>dominative</hi> or <hi>imperial;</hi> it is only <hi>declarative,</hi> and not <hi>deciſive,</hi> not <hi>coactive</hi> and <hi>compulſive;</hi> it is exerciſed in Chriſts Name, and in his ſtead, and is the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:39286:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his ſpecial preſence in his Church: theſe are incompatible with the Government of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, whoſe power is Supream, Magiſterial, and Imperial, coactive and compulſive; and exerciſed in his owne name, &amp;c.(2.) The Magiſtrat cannot, yea may not exerciſe the Government of the Church, being diſenabled thereto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the commands and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſt, who hath laid the burden thereof on others, and not on him. The moſt grant, the Magiſtrat himſelf may not exerciſe ſome parts of this Government, as ordaining of perſons for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, excommunicating, &amp;c. and why he may do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts and acts belonging to it, and not theſe, We deſire proofe: all our antagoniſts arguments in this conclude for the whole. <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats have exerciſed both powers, as <hi>Moſes, Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, David, Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe were both Magiſtrats and Prophets; and it is evident from the Scripture, that what they did either in conſtituting or in exerciſing of the Government of the Church, they did it as Prophets, and not as Magiſtrats: we find Magiſtrats, that were not Prophets, attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, &amp; reprehended for ſo doing, as <hi>Saul, Uzziah:</hi> which ſays, that it did not belong to their Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Office.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. That Goverment that is founded upon and regulated by another rule and inſtrument, then the law of the civil Magiſtrat, is diſtinct from his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: But the Government of the Church is founded upon, and ruled by another law or rule, then the Magiſtrats; the law and word of Chriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c. the <hi>firſt propoſition</hi> is clear, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Magiſtrat does flow from and is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:39286:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>by his owne lawes, of which he is the ſole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:) The <hi>ſecond,</hi> we ſuppoſe, is undenyable among Chriſtians, who acknowledge the Scriptures for a rule of Doctrine, Worship and Government to the Church of Chriſt. <hi>Obj</hi> But there are ſomethings neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare to the Government of the Church, not contained in the Scriptures? <hi>Anſ.</hi> This we deny. For
1. What the Scriptures containe, anent the Government of the Church (if reduced to practice) is able to attaine its ends, and more is not neceſſary: Let the Church have theſe, and the work will be done: we make &amp; feigne neceſſitles, but no more is neceſſar to the ends of the Church Government, then what is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Scriptures anent it.(2.) The ability of the Churches Government, for reaching its ends, lyes not in the innate ſufficiency of its inſtituted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but in the Spirit of Chriſt, working with, in, and by them; by which low, weak and deſpicable wayes, Chriſt carries on the ſalvation of his people, that the excellency of the power may be of him, and not of us.(3.) The Scriptures being a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule for all maters of faith and obedience, what it containes of, and anent the Government of the Church, muſt be perfect and ſufficient: ſure we are, the Churches Government is a good work, and its exerciſe, acts of obedience to Chriſt Jeſus; anent which it is ſaid I. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. The Scripturs are able to make the Man of God perfect, throughly furnished to every good work.(4.) We enquire, when the Church is without a Chriſtian Magiſtrat, and under the feet of a heathenish perſecuting one (in which caſe our oppoſits grant her a Government diſtinct from, and independent on the Magiſtrat) whether
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:39286:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Government exerciſed in her, be able to attaine its ends. If it be (as the experience of the Church in this caſe puts beyond doubt) why may it not do the ſame, under a Chriſtian Magiſtrat?</p>

The deſignations, denominations and relations, in and with which the Church is repreſented in the Scriptures, do alſo confirme this truth; she is called the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>City of God,</hi> the <hi>Houſe of the living God, the new Jeruſalem.</hi> As all theſe do neceſſarily import a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church; ſo they inſinuat the ſame to be different from all other Governments: Which we may mould into this Argument. That ſociety which is the body of Chriſt, &amp;c. muſt have a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment diſtinct from the Government of the civil Magiſtrat: But the Church is that ſociety, that is only the body of Chriſt, &amp;c.

The Magiſtrat is not the fountaine of Church power; it hath not its derivation from him; and therefore is not directly ſubordinat to him: The conſequence is founded on this truth, granted by all Lawyers and Divines, that all power directly ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat to, and dependant on the Magiſtrat, is derived from him as the fountaine thereof: the <hi>antecedent</hi> we prove thus.
(1.) The Magiſtrat as a Magiſtrat is not a member of the Church, but as a Profeſſor of Chriſtianity, which intitles others to this priviledge, as much as him; Therefore he cannot be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Church power as ſuch; for whoever is the fountaine of power to any ſociety, is a member, yea the nobleſt member of it; <hi>Obj.</hi> But as a chriſtian Magiſtrat he is a member of the Church? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. What then? will this prove him to be the fountaine of Church power? ſo might Chriſtian Huſbands, Parents, &amp;c. argue as juſtly for this clame: the truth is, he being only a member of the Church, as a Chriſtian, and not as a Magiſtrat, Magiſtracy gives him no more priviledge, then any other power, civil or natural, when the perſon tuines Chriſtian; for the benefite of membership goes on grounds and reaſons common to all Chriſtians, and containes no ſpeciality to one more then to another. If any think Magiſtracy does, they shall do well to prove it, which none hath yet offered to do. 2. If men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood well, what it is to be a Chriſtian, a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and member of Chriſt's Church, they would quickly ſee its inconſiſtency with the ſaid profeſſion,

He may not exerciſe Church power; Therefore is not the fountaine of it: all yeeld, that theſe who are the fountaine of power to others may exerciſe it themſelves, it being in them, and others acting, as their delegates, in its exerciſe: that the Magiſtrat may not exerciſe Church power, is clear; for Church power, being by poſitive inſtitution from Chriſt, they that exerciſe it muſt have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him, which none hath prodduced for the Magiſtrat: <hi>Eraſtus</hi> aſſerteth it, but without all proofe, of which it is ſo deſtitute, that the moſt of his followers have left him in this aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. All Church power is lodged in and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly deſcended from Chriſt Jeſus, as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head and Ruler of the Church, and Superiour to the Magiſtrat: Therefore it is not ſubordinat to the Magiſtrat: The reaſon of the conſequence is clear, for it is a repugnancy in a power to be immediatly ſubordinat to two Supream powers, in one and the ſame reſpects; eſpecially where the one is ſuperiour to the other: The <hi>antecedent</hi> is manifeſt, for Chriſt is only head of the Church; all power in her is inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute by him; exerced in his name; aſtricted to, and regulated by his word; and accomptable to him. All notes of power immediatly deſcended from him. <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Chriſtian Magiſtrat, as Chriſts ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and vicegerent, is under him, the neareſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat fountaine of Church power; for <hi>ſubordinata non pugnant? Anſ.</hi> Long hath the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rended for this, and on grounds more plauſible, then
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:39286:88"/>theſe, on which the Magiſtrat goes. But Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines anſwer to the Papiſts on this head, furnish us with irrefragable anſwers to the Magiſtrats clame; which we deſire our adverſaries would conſider &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at their own leaſure: we finde not the Magiſtrat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled among the officers of the Church, far leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for Chriſts vicegerent; if there be any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for this, bring it forth? We know of none as yet alledged by our adverſaries; but what will plead as ſtrongly, for the heathenish Magiſtrat, as for the Chriſtian: And if they do, what traitours were the Apoſtles, Miniſters and Chriſtians of the primitive times, that did not acknowledge the heathenish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates for their head in the Church; but reſiſted and diſobeyed their lawes and edicts againſt them, for crying up of another K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All Church power was inſtitute by Chriſt, in an immediat ſubordination to himſelf; without any acknowledgment of, or dependance on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat: Therefore it is not dependant upon, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat to him: The <hi>antecedent</hi> is clear from the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the New Teſtament, where we find, that Chriſt moulded and conſtituted the Church by his Apoſtles, and furnished her with a Government and officers, to be exerciſed in his name; and all this he did without conſulring, or adviſing with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, or ſuſpending of her upon him; the Magiſtrat all this time reſiſting &amp; letting himſelf, for crushing of this Church &amp; Kingdome of Chriſt; which he erected in the midſt of their Kingdomes, making uſe of their rage and violence to eſtablish and propagat it, for ſome Hundreds of years. All this is ſo evident, that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:39286:89"/>our adverſaries are not able to refuſe it; what is there then to hinder the conſequence, that we draw from this deed of Chriſt? If our oppoſites in this mater could shew us, that the Church had no government inſtitute by Chriſt; nor exerciſed any, all the time that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat thus oppoſed himſelf to her; or that Chriſt had declared his will, that she should be ſubjected to the Magiſtrat in her Government, when he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtian; they would ſoon end this ſtrife: but nothing can we learne from them to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. As this Government was inſtitute by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; ſo it was exerced in his name in the Church, without dependance on the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, till <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great's time; and from thence downe ward, till the Reformation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brack up in <hi>Germanie:</hi> till which time, it was never queſtioned by any, until <hi>Eraſtus</hi> the Phyſician aroſe, who laboured not only to ſubject the Church to the Magiſtrat, in all her concearnes as ſuch; but denied all Government to her by divine inſtitution, that is diſtinct from the Government of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat; contrare to full and clear Scripture, which he moſt inſolently and wickedly endeavours to wreſt &amp; pervert. So then if the Government of the Church was in Scripture times, and downwards, till within theſe hundered years, exerciſed without dependance on the Magiſtrat, both heathenish and Chriſtian; then it muſt yet be independant on, and not directly ſubordinat to him. Here our Antagoniſts are put to ſtrange shifts; The firſt three hundred years, they muſt grant; and may we not take this for a yeelding of the cauſe? Scripture and antiquity hath been held for a ſufficient plea, for maters of doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:39286:89"/>debates in Polemical divinity hath run on theſe two heads; and whoever made out their aſſertions from theſe, have been eſteemed to carry the cauſe: all that our adverſaries have to ſay to this, are theſe two.
1. That the Government exerciſed in the Church was not by divine inſtitution and precepts; but by confederation of Churches and officers. To this we <hi>reply.</hi>
1. If the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia. Revel.</hi>2. and 3. <hi>Chapters;</hi> with other places of Scripture, uſed by our Divines, in this mater, prove not the contrary, they have no ſenſe: We beg of our adverſaries, they will, for ſaving us a labour, anſwer Mr. <hi>Gilleſpies</hi> Arguments from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the ſecond part of his <hi>Aarons Rod bloſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>2. Beſids they are not able to make out what they aſſert, to wit, that the Church did exerciſe her Government in theſe times, by confederation and mutual conſent; and not by inſtitution and command: for as there is nothing in Scripture and pure antiquity for this; So the Churches being gathered and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute by the Apoſtles, we preſume, they continued in the conſtitutions, which the Apoſtles left, according to the precepts and rules they gave them; to which we find, in the word and Church Hiſtory, their practice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. When the perſecutions of the Church ceaſed, upon the Magiſtrats turning Chriſtian, we find her continuing, in the exerciſe of the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (but with the addition of ſome corruptions, which grew to a ſad hight afterwards, throw the exceſſive munificence &amp; bounty of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, the firſt Chriſtian Emperour) and exerciſing the ſame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, as formerly; as is clear from Hiſtory; that ſpeaks of theſe times. Here our adverſaries ſpeak
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:39286:90"/>of ſome inſtances of the power, the Magiſtrat did exerce in the Church; as convocating of Synods, labouring in the peace of the Church, lorely rent at ſometimes, through lad hereſies and ſchiſms; And that ſaying of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> repeated by them, <hi>ad nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeam: vos eſtis Epiſcopi ad intra, Ego ad extra.</hi> But how is our Antagoniſts concluſion made out by all theſe? will it follow, that becaus the Magiſtrat did convocat Synods, its Government is derived from, &amp; ſubordinat to him? No wayes, for
(1.) Albeit the Magiſtrat have a power to convocat the officers of the Church, anent maters relating to his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and duty, whether about Church or State; yet this is not privative of the Churches power to convocat her owne aſſemblies, either for worship or government; as we find she did in the primitive times, not only without but againſt his conſent; yea when the Magiſtrat became Chriſtian, she retained and exerciſed this power in aſſembling into ſeveral Synods, without the Magiſtrat. It is true, we do not read of general Synods aſſembled, after this, but by the Magiſtrat, till the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> claimed this power, and uſurped therein on the Church and Magiſtrat, as he did in all other things, but the vaſtneſs of the Empire, and large extent of the Church (which exceeded its bounds) made this in point of prudence neceſſare, for without the Magiſtrat, it could not eaſily be done. But(2.) Convocating of others, is not alwayes, in its ſelf, and infallible ſigne of a ſuperiour power and dominion over judicatories convocated; as in limited Monarchies, and not abſolute, where the Supream power is lodged in the King and States of the Kingdom; although the

The Chriſtian Magiſtrat, is by vertue of his Chriſtian Profeſſion, bound to ſubject himſelf to the acts &amp; exerciſe of Church Government, in the hand of Church Officers; and is as much obleidged to yeeld thereto, as any other: Therefore Church power is not directly ſubordinat to him. The antecedent is clear; for all are commanded ſubmiſſion and obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to Church Officers, in the exerciſe of their power, in watching, overſeeing, and ruleing of the Church <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. to which exerciſe of their power, we finde Magiſtrats in the word ſubmitting, as <hi>UZ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZIA,</hi> who was by the prieſts, confor me to the law, ſeparated and ſecluded from the holy things of God, and communion with the Church in theſe; yea, it is given for the maine cauſe of all that heavy wrath and judgment, that came on <hi>Zedekiah</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.12. that he humbled not himſelf before <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the Prophet, ſpeaking the word of the Lord to him, <hi>Obj.</hi> But this ſubjection in Magiſtrats to Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, is properly to Chriſt, and not to them? <hi>Anſ.</hi> we confeſs, the ſubjection is primarily and cheifly to Chriſt Jeſus, whom ſuch, in the exerciſe of their Office, doe repreſent; yet the ſubjection is to them too, whom all, without exception of any in the Church, are commanded to receive, hear and obey: ſo that in the diſpenſation of holy things, they are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:39286:91"/>ſuperiour to all in the Church, Magiſtrats and others, as their conſtitut Rulers, Overſeers, Governours and Watch men, whom they ought to obey; when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in their Office, agreable to the law of Chriſt: which obedience is not <hi>CATACHRESTICAL</hi> or <hi>ABUSIVE</hi> (as <hi>VIDELIUS</hi> ſpeaks) in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat, but proper and really, a debt they owe to the Miniſters of the Goſpel diſpenſing holy things, as much as any other member of the Church; their obligation to it being of the ſame kinde and nature, with the obligation of others. If any think other-wayes, let them produce their reaſons and Scriptures. 2. If the fiery and zealous promotters of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats power, in and over the Church of God, did conſider the true and real prejudice they do to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats, by exeeming them from that ſubjection, that they, with all others, owe to Church Officers, they would (if there be any ſenſe of Religion and its advantages remaining with men) hold their hand; and should have little thanks from Magiſtrats, for their prepoſterous zeal, who, by their opinions in this mater, do really exclude Magiſtrats from the Communion of the Church, and the benefite of the ordinance of Church Government, which in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne and effects is for ſaving of the ſoul, as well as all other ordinances.

But, before we enter on the probation of this, it will be neceſſare, for clearing our way to it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alittle two things, in the beginning of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the act of reſtitution, repeated in ſeveral acts: where, <hi>firſt,</hi> the Government of the Church is called the external Government of the ſame: the tearm, <hi>EXTERNAL,</hi> being Notourly ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, should have been explained, &amp; all not left to gueſs at its meaning: <hi>EXTERNAL</hi> is by ſome oppoſed to the <hi>internal inviſible Government of Chriſt</hi> on the ſouls of his people; and ſo by it they underſtand, the viſible intrinſick Government of the viſible Church: that this is meant by the tearm <hi>EXTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL GOVERNMENT,</hi> in this and other acts, the following Arguments undertake to make out: but
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:39286:92"/>ſome others oppoſe the terme <hi>EXTERNAL GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT,</hi> to this intrinſick viſible Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, formerly deſcribed and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſtinct from, and independant on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat; and by it they do underſtand, theſe humane adjuncts and accidents, that are civil in themſelves, and not made ſacred by divine inſtitution: ſome plead this to be the ſenſe of theſe terms, in the acts of Parlt; but how groundleſly let our ſubſequent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons determine. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is there ſaid, that the ordering and diſpoſing of the external government of the Church belongs to the Crowne, &amp;c. it is hard to ſenſe this; for ordering and diſpoſing, when done by perſons in authority, is a part of government in it ſelf; and if it be ſo, the Phraſe is equivalent to this, the governing of the external government of the Church: which is a ſtrange ſort of ſpeach, as if a government needed a government to governe it: What if this were ſaid of the government of the government of the State? Would it not be reputed non ſenſe? But the truth is, all governments do neceſſarily imply a power to diſpoſe and order all things relating to it, as a part of the ſame; &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it were imperfect; and it is without diſput evident from the experience of the Church under heathenish Magiſtrats; that the government of the Church had this, which by this act is taken from her. <hi>Next,</hi> we ask, whether this ordering and dipoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be an act of the Eccleſiaſtick or civil government? If it be of the Eccleſiaſtick, it is againe non-ſenſe, at the beſt; and is as much as if it had been ſaid, the Eccleſiaſtical governing of the Eccleſiaſtical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; a perfect tautology, But if it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:39286:93"/>be an act of the civil government; how comes it, that in this and other acts of Parliament, it is called the <hi>Kings Eccleſiaſtical Government,</hi> in oppoſition to the civil? <hi>Obj.</hi> It is only objectively ſo called. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then it is properly and formally civil, the phraſe, objectively Eccleſiaſtical being <hi>CATACHRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STICAL</hi> and <hi>ABUSIVE;</hi> a very improper ſpeach; yea as improper, as if we should call Church po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or Government, in the hands of Church officers, objectively civil, or civil. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the laſt place we deſire to know, whether this ordering or diſpoſing of the Government of the Church be neceſſary, or not? If it be not neceſſary, why is the Church troubled with it? If it be, we ask againe, when it was exerciſed by the Church, whether it was an act of civil or Church Government? It could not be of the civil; for the Church had none under perſecuting Magiſtrats; if it was an act of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical or Church Government; then it was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely and formally ſuch; and not truely civil, although exerciſed about things civil in their owne nature, and ſeing it was ſo, how comes it to be the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats now? To any conſiderat and unbyaffed reader, it will be manifeſt, that theſe words or expreſſions come from mindes, deſigning the enhanſing of the intrinſick viſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>le Government of the Church, and withall labouring to cover it; but all in vaine.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Eccleſiaſtical Government of the Church, formally and intrinſically ſuch, is aſſumed by, and given to the Magiſtrat, in the preſent ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawes, will be apparent to any that conſider theſe things, in the forecited <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
(1.) That Church officers, in the exerciſe of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:39286:93"/>in their Church aſſemblies or judicatories, are put in dependance upon, and ſubordinated to the King, as Supream to them therein: this makes the King the fountaine of Church power, &amp; the Church officers to derive and hold their power of him; which makes our King the proper Head of the Church, &amp; ſubſtituts him in Chriſts roome to her.(2.) The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, thus ſubjected to &amp; depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the King as Supream, is, in the <hi>act of reſtitution,</hi> extended to and made to take in ordination, acts of diſcipline, inflicting of Church cenſures; yea to all cauſes and matters formally Eccleſiaſtical; to all, about which Church power is exerced, he is made the ſupream.(3.) All Church power and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as it was exerciſed in this Church (before the late introduction of prelacy) without this deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from and ſubordination to the Magiſtrat, is reſcinded and annulled; certainly in theſe times, the Magiſtrat had and did exerciſe a power about Church matters; as is to be ſeen in the laws then made in their behalf; but this does not now content, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ſupremacy; which imports another power acclamed by the Magiſtrat now, that was not then.(4.) This <hi>ſupremacy,</hi> and (as it is called) the <hi>Royal prerogative of the Crown,</hi> is given for the maine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the change made in the Government of the Church, in overturning and caſting out of the true government, that then was, and bringing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its ſtead, without the authority and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Church: a fair opened doore, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the like alteration and change in doctrine and worship, when there is acceſs to it.(5.) Prelacy by this act is reſtored, not only to the former height
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39286:94"/>it was at, and had attained by law and practice, before its laſt ejection out of this Church; but alſo to all that ever it was, even in the times of popery; which when conſidered, in the conſtitution and priviledges it then had, was an humane Office founded on the Supremacy of the <hi>Pope;</hi> but now, by this law, on the Magiſtrat: which ſayes, that although the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be changed, yet the Supremacy is the ſame.(6.) In the act anent the <hi>National Synod,</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and election of perſons, by who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The right, being and conſtitution of the National Synod of this Church, is wholly dependant upon, and derived from this law; So as it is no Synod of this Church, that is not gathered, and conſtitute conforme to it; although a Synod in this Church should have all, that made Synods lawful, and their acts obligatory, in former times.(8.) The particular conſtitution of this National Synod, as to its members, (which in this act are nominated and regulated thereby, for all future times) is determined for its' times and places of meeting, and put wholly in the Kings hand, and aſſerted to be his right, by vertue of his Supremacy over this Church: It is no Synod that is not thus convocated.(9.) The maters to be handled, debated, and concluded in this Synod (a thing alwayes judged intrinſick to the Church) comes only from the King, &amp; are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:39286:94"/>from him, by the <hi>Arch-prelat of Saint Andrews</hi> and no other: a fearful reſtraining of the divine liberty of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who may not ſpeak of maters of doctrine &amp; manners, (although neceſſary for the times) contrare to the freedome, that is commanded them by their maſter, anent theſe.(10.) The King's, or his Commiſſioners preſence is made eſſential to the conſtitution, and of binding force to this nationall Synod: It is no Synod, although con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute after the paterne of Church Synods, in the primitive times; if it want this.(11.) No mater debated and concluded by the Majority of this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, is obligatory on this Church, and its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if not approven and allowed by the King or his Commiſſioner. This ſuſpends the intrinſick obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Synods on the King; ſo that no canon, act or conſtitution, do binde the members of the Church, if he aſſent not: As this ſecures the Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the act aſſerting the Kings Supremacy Eccleſiaſtick, the King &amp; his ſucceſſors are enabled and impowered to medle with all maters and meetings Eccleſiaſtick, which brings the doctrine and worship within his verge, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the ſame to him, as much as the government.(13.) They are impowered to enact and emit conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, acts, and orders, anent maters and meetings Eccleſiaſtick, as they pleaſe and think fit, and are not, in the making of theſe, aſtricted to any rule, but their pleaſure, <hi>O HORRENDUM!</hi>(14.) All theſe acts and orders they may ſtatute, independant on the Church, Parliament, or any other, by their ſole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

In the act againſt unlawful Ordinations (as they call them) the Ordination of perſons to the Miniſtry, by Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus, that have not conformed to Prelacy, (which was held unqueſtionable &amp; valid for its ſubſtance by all, till this late gang of Prelats aroſe, in which they are degenerat from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours) is, by the ſole authority of the Magiſtrat, made void; and all Miniſterial acts, and Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites depending thereon, declared to be nul. An act that unchriſtians and condemns all the reformed Churches, making their Churches no Miniſterial political Churches, and all Ordinances, diſpenſed in them, nullities: which their practice at this time in <hi>England</hi> does confirme; while Romish Prieſts turning Proteſtants, are, without ordination, made capable, and advanced to Church places and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which the Proteſtant Miniſters of other Churches, conforming to Prelacy, are dented, till they be reordained. Other mediums contained in other acts of Parliaments, for fixing of the preceeding
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:39286:95"/>concluſions, we paſſe; having hinted at ſome of them above; judging theſe ſufficient, for the conviction of the unintereſſed &amp; unprejudged; who through the power of luſt and earthly intereſt, have not caſt off the light of the word, but keeps in ſubjection to it.</p>
                  <p>We shall in the laſt place anſwer ſome objections; in which, we have to do with two ſortes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; <hi>firſt,</hi> the high flowne <hi>Eraſtians</hi> of our times, who will admit of no government in the Church, but that which is in and from the Magiſtrat whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, (as is evident from the act aſſerting the Kings Supremacy) is, to take all Government out of the Churches hands; and to put it on the King &amp; his Councel, to be only exerciſed by them: which, throw the diſlike of Prelacy, is not ſufficiently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, laid to heart, nor reſiſted by many, as its dangerous conſequences, to all the concerns of the Church, do require. Beſides theſe, there are who, (upon what principle is not yet known,) think that the Supremacy, as it is now aſſerted by law, is not formally Eccleſiaſtical, but only objectively ſo; which is ſtrange: ſome of the objections of the firſt ſort, we have met with, as we went along the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heads; we know of no other, beſides theſe, of any conſiderable ſtrength; but one.</p>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:39286:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>and shew it cannot bear their concluſion.
1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever power the Chriſtian Magiſtrat can clame by this, the heathenish Magiſtrat hath the ſame; he is by his Magiſtratical office conſtitute, <hi>in actu primo,</hi> a Keeper of both tables; as is evident from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13: 1, 2. If he do not exerciſe it, it comes not from any defect of power in his office, or the inſtitution of it; but from his blindneſs and unbeleef, which indiſpoſes him to anſwer his truſt, and to do the work of his office; to which, upon the revelation of the Goſpel, he is bound: and ſeing it is ſo, either the Church, in exerciſing of her Government independantly on heathenish Magiſtrats, uſurped on his office &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; which the adverſary dare no ſay: Or els the Chriſtian Magiſtrat hath no more power in &amp; over rhe Church, then the other had: and therefore the Church, in exerciſing her power under the Chriſtian Magiſtrat, does not uſurp upon him, more then on the other.2. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are, by vertue of their office, Keepers of both tables of the law, of the table of Righteouſneſs, as well as of the table of Religion: will it from thence follow, that they may medle with the Magiſtrats office, and aſſume its exerciſe; or that the ſame does depend on them? No wayes: and yet the conſequence is as good in the one as in the other: by the ſame medium we shall prove Miniſters, have as good right and power to manage the affairs of the State; as the Magiſtrat hath (in our adverſaries ſenſe) to manage the affairs of the Church. We know they will reject the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence with diſdaine, as to Miniſters, and ask for our proofe, for which, we grant, they have juſt cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo we deny the conſequence as to the Magiſtrat, for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:39286:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>which they have not given us yet any colourable proofe; but dictator-like aſſert it. The truth is, every man in his capacity is a Keeper of both tables of the law; but in doing of it, is to hold within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his ſtation, the nature, and limites of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer granted him; and is not to invade the office and power of others, nor the work proper thereto: as is evident from multitude of precepts in the Word of God. So if Miniſters, notwithſtanding their being Keepers of the tables of the law, may not invade the Magiſtrats office and power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So neither may Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats invade the Miniſterial office and power.3. The acts and wayes of the Magiſtrats keeping of the tables of the law, should anſwer, and be agreable to the nature, extent, and limits of his office &amp; power; within the verge of which, he is to walk, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are to do in theirs: As Miniſters are to keep both the tables of the law by preaching the word, diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ordinances, and exerciſing of diſcipline, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the word; to which they are impowered by the inſtitutions and commands of Chriſt, without dependance on the Magiſtrat; ſo the Magiſtrat is to keep them likwiſe, by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to their ſeveral duties, protecting them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the ſword, which is given him for that end; executing of juſtice in punishing of evil doers, and rewarding the good, &amp;c. but is not to medle with the Government of the Church, in whole or in part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to ſee that it be done by theſe, whom Chriſt hath called to and intruſted with it.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>objected</hi> by others, that it is not the intrinſick viſible and internal Government of the Church, that the Magiſtrat aſſumes, in the acts of Parliament; it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:39286:97"/>is only the external Government, that is expreſſely ſo called, in the act of reſtitution? <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is materially Anſwered above; but that we may be diſtinct, there are two things belonging to the Church.
(1.) The outward and external adjuncts or accidents; As the <hi>Biotica</hi> or <hi>Mundana,</hi> Stipends, Manſe Glybs, outward liberty and peace, &amp;c.(2.) The proper and true objects of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or power, that are intrinſick to it, although viſible; as the Word, Ordinances, Miniſtery and neceſſary circumſtances &amp;c. It is not the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, but the <hi>ſecond</hi> that the act of reſtitution with other acts do truely mean, as is undoubtedly made out by the former arguments; as particularly the firſt three: that it is the Church judicatories; the maters hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in and by them, proper thereto, that conſtituts the King Supream; theſe being eſſential and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to the Government of the Church, in its ſeveral parts: he that is made ſupream to theſe, is made ſupream to the Church, and all that appertaine to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But it is only the ordering and diſpoſeing of the Government, that is declared to belong to the King. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is ſo ſaid in that act, but it is evident from the mater and frame of it, that it is the Government in whole that is truely meant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as is formerly proven. But 2. Ordering and diſpoſing of things, proper and ſpecifick to any Government, is a part of the Government it ſelf; and to whom the Government belongs, the ordering of it belongs likwiſe: by the ſame reaſons that any shall undertake to prove, that the ordering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeing of the civil Government belongs to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:39286:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>we shall prove the ordering and diſpoſing of the Churches Government does belong to Church Officers: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>no Government can be perfect without it, or able to attaine its ends, and therefore muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be implyed in, and intrinſick to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. But there are ſome acts of Church power the Magiſtrat may do, as convocating of Synods, determining of circumſtances, indicting of publict faſts and thanksgivings? <hi>Anſ</hi> As we deny all formal Church power to the Magiſtrat, and all acts formally proceding therefrom; ſo we grant there are acts, <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſome common as prayer, rebuking, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing of others, and others of the like nature: which, when they come from a Church Officer, are <hi>authoritative</hi> and acts of Church power; that are yet performable by others, in their ſtations, and (ſo to ſpeak) are <hi>charitative.</hi> 2. Some are proper and only belongs to Church Officers, as preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, diſpenſing of the Sacraments, exerciſe of Church diſcipline, &amp;c. We doe not deny, but chierfully grant (wishing with all our hearts, there were many ſuch Magiſtrats in the Church) that the Magiſtrat ought to rebuke, to exhort, admonish, inſtruct &amp; pray, &amp;c. As all others in their ſtations and offices should do; but from thence it will not follow, that he may exerciſe formal acts of Church power, more then others; or that the Church power is dependant on him: the Conſequence is wide. But to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances; as, that of convocating of Synods or any Church judicatory, we ſay, it is within the verge of his power, as a Magiſtrat, who may and ought to command all within his dominions, to their ſeveral duties, and Miniſters among others, as they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:39286:98"/>ought to doe to him, ſo the Magiſtrats convocating of Miniſters, is but a putting of them to their duty, which in the Magiſtrat is no act of Church power; but an act of his office he owes to all. 2. This act or deed of the Magiſtrat, is not privative of the ſame in the Officers of the Church, who may &amp; ought come together of themſelves, as the neceſſities of the Church requires. On the by, it is an evil conſequence; the Magiſtrat may gather Synods; therefore Miniſters may not doe it: It is like to this, others may rebuke, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, &amp;c. Therefore Miniſters may not doe it. For although the Magiſtrat have an imperative power, over all; yet it is not privative of any power in others, that is proper to their ſtation and office. (2.) As for the determining of the circumſtances in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we reply, there are two ſorts of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces relateing to theſe, firſt ſome extrinſick, and not in themſelves ſimply neceſſare, although convenient; as Churches of ſuch and ſuch formes, pulpets, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, &amp;c. Theſe, being in their natural uſe civil, belong to the Magiſtrat, and are directly under his power, to order and diſpoſe, <hi>Next</hi> 2. There are ſome circumſtances intrinſick to the actions of worship and Government, and ſo connected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, in that degree of neceſſity, that they cannot be performed without them; and come within the compaſs of divine commands, on which, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of individual actions, as to their goodnes and evil, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> does depend; as ſuch and ſuch perſons, doctrines, times, places, helps, &amp;c. which all moraliſts and divines make to ſpecify all humane actions, as to their morality <hi>in individuo.</hi> Of theſe we aſſert, that the determination of them,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:39286:98"/>as they reſpect worship and Government, and are connected with them, belongs to the Officers of the Church, and not to the Magiſtrat: we have given ſome reaſons for this before, as
1. we ſee commands given to the Church about them, and not to the Magiſtrat; 1. Cor. 14.2. If the determination of theſe were in the Magiſtrats power, it should be likewiſe in his power, to hinder, impede and obſtruct all right worship and Government, in its exerciſe, at his pleaſure for whoever hath theſe things in his power, without which, the actions of worship and Government cannot be performed, hath the actions in his power to hinder or not.3. The conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of granting this to the Magiſtrat are miſcheivous: for by this, if he do not wholly hinder the exerciſe of the Miniſterial office and power; yet he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict and limit it ſo, as to bring them under dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unfaithfulneſs in their Miniſtry or office; he may binde them up from preaching ſuch and ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, that, at ſuch and ſuch times and in ſuch caſes, God calleth them to preach. As for the (3.) Inſtance, for indicting of dayes for ſolemne faſting and humiliation or of thankſgiving; we ſay, that we reckon it among theſe common duties of Religion, that every Chirſtian, in his ſtation, is bound by the command of God to obſerve; and according to the extent of their power to ſee them obſerved by others under them, when the diſpenſations of mercy and judgment cals them to theſe; as is clear from the precepts and examples we have in the word; ſo that all Chriſtians, in their ſeveral capacities, offices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> powers and extent of the ſame, have the power of indicting and keeping of ſuch times and dayes; as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:39286:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>Maſters in families, paſtours in congregations, or in their aſſociations, and Magiſtrats, &amp;c. From this it will not follow, that Magiſtrats, Maſters of Families, &amp;c. their indicting of ſuch dayes for divine exerciſes, is an act of Church power; although it be ſuch in the Officers of the Church, and as it comes from them: no more then others rebuking, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c. is an act of Church authority and power, although it be ſo from them. 2. That it only belongs to the Magiſtrat to indict dayes of publict faſtings, or of thankſgiving, &amp; not to the paſtours of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where hath our antagoniſts learned this? We grant the Magiſtrat participats with others in this power; but the nature of theſe duties, the precepts, and examples of the word, impowers others in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, as much as him: it were eaſy to make this out. We acknowledge, for the more harmony in this publict work, and convenient following of it, with benefite and advantage to Church and State, it were expedient, that Magiſtrats and Miniſters did previously conſult, and agree about publict faſts and thankſgiving: but to affirme this, to the privation of the power and obligations, laid on others anent it; is not only an encroachment on the divine rights of others, but a looſing of theſe bonds, with which God hath tyed them; and what is this but to fight againſt God in the perſones of his Creaturs.</p>

The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, by vertue of his profeſſed ſubjection to Chriſt, is bound to give an accompt of his actings in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to Miniſters and others, when he proveth ſcandalous and offenſive: which many of them have done. To this they are obliedged, both on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of their promiſed ſubjection to the word, its ordinances; and Chriſts ſervants, diſpenſing the ſame; and likewiſe on the accompt of Charity and love, that binds all, not only to endeavour the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, but removing of offences, when given; to which the Magiſtrat is as incident, in his capacity, as others; as alas ſad experience puts beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate!</p>

But as the Government of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and its exerciſe, is the object of the Magiſtrats po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and its acts; does he not act about thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perially, and <hi>Architectonice?</hi> And if it be ſo, is he not Supream to &amp; above the Miniſters of the Church, and they ſubordinat to him? <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the greateſt ſeeming ſtrength; but on a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of it, its weakneſs will ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. We yeeld, without any advantage to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies cauſe, that what the Magiſtrat does as ſuch, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Church maters and officers, he does it imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and with dominion, and (as they uſe to ſpeak) <hi>Architectonice:</hi> but what then? It proves the perſons to be ſubordinat to the Magiſtrat in theſe his acts; but not the power in its exerciſe; nor the maters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:39286:100"/>which it is exerciſed, for
(1.) The Magiſtrat, when he by his irreligious and unjuſt carriage in his office, or other wayes, becomes notoriouſly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to the Church, is lyable to Miniſterial admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, rebukes, ſecluſions from the Sacraments, &amp;c. And is thereby ſubordinat to Church power, or the Miniſters of Chriſt in exercing it about him; and yet the Magiſtratical power, and its exerciſe, is not ſubject to them, whatever reſiſtence our oppoſits make to this mutual ſubordination of the perſons of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats and Miniſters: yet they muſt either deny the Chriſtian Magiſtrats the benefits of the Goſpel &amp; its ordinances, diſpenſed by Miniſters; or els yeeld this truth. Is it not clear in other powers or relations? as ſuppone, one is both a Magiſtrat and a Son, is there not here a reciprocal ſubordination and ſuperiority of perſons with a coordination of powers, as is hinted above? We plead no more for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the Government of the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to them. We grant a great difference in other reſpects, betwixt the Magiſtrat and Miniſters; they act as meer ſervants, without all dominion in them; He with dominion and Magiſtratical authority over the perſons of Miniſters: yet for all this the powers are coordinat, and in their exerciſe not directly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to one another.(2.) Theſe powers, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and reſpective objects becoming reciprocally the object of one another (as the Miniſtry and its objects being one part of the Magiſtrats power, the Magiſtrat and the objects of his power, being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a part of the object about which Miniſters exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their power) under different formalities and ſpecifications, there ariſes or reſults, not only a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39286:100"/>ſweet harmony, and a mutual ſubſerviency to one another, in advancing of their reſpective ends; but likewiſe an indirect ſubordination to one another, in the exerciſe of their powers, without any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of theſe powers upon one another. But this ſubordination is only of the perſons, and not of the powers: which by being the mutual objects of one anothers powers, does not ſubject the power, and its exerciſe, but only the perſons; for any thing or power becoming the object of another, does not ſubordinat it to that power; the Word, Ordinances, &amp;c. are not, by being the object either of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial or the Magiſtratical power, ſubordinated or ſubject thereto; ſo that the Miniſterial power, its exerciſe, and the maters about which it converſes, are not by being the object of the Magiſtrats power ſubordinated to it. This breaks the force of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Argument which lyes mainly in this.</p>

It is only this ſort of Supremacy and ſubordination, that the act of reſtitution does mean? <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not ſo, as is clear from the words and frame of the acts; for it is the Church aſſemblies, their proper maters, their conſtitution, the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick obligation of their concluſions, that are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated to the Magiſtrat; ſo that all is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him.</p>

All Divines, even the Presbyterians and independents in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> grant the Magiſtrat to be Supream in all cauſes, and over all perſons Eccleſiaſtical; none of them ſcruple to take the oath of Supremacy, as it is eſtablished by law in that Kingdom? <hi>Anſ.</hi> All Divines do not grant this, as is to be ſeen in the writings of many; and for any
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:39286:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>thing we know, it is not yeelded by the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and Independants, in the ſenſe controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; neither can it, ſeing it quyt overthrows, all Church Government, in its diſtinction from and independency on the civil Government of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, which is contrare to the known principles both of Presbyterians and Independants; and if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats themſelves durſt ſpeak their minde, conforme to their owne principles, they would not in this differ from us (as <hi>Thorndike</hi> more free and engenuous then the reſt of his party does declame and cry out againſt the oath of Supremacy, as the great crying ſin of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>) but to an exceſſe, would aſſert all, and much more, then we do, in this mater, were it not for fear of offending the Magiſtrat, on whom now they wholly depend, and whoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs they only are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And although the Presbyterians and Independants, in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do take the oath of Supremacy, yet it is with ſuch explications, allowed &amp; aſſented to by the Magiſtrat, that give it a ſound ſenſe, which was ſtumbled and ſcrupled at both in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> times, till its ſenſe was explicat, and allowed; as is to be ſeen in the inſtructions given to juſtices of the peace, by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the ſaid oath; &amp; Bishop <hi>Ushers</hi> explanation of it, approven by King <hi>James:</hi> In which ſenſe it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood &amp; taken to this day among them. But to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this mater aright, and to avoid the labyrinth of generalities &amp; ambiguities, with which, ſome divines
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:39286:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>perplex &amp; intricat it; it would be conſidered.
1. That there is a two fold proper ſupremacy, one civil, and another Eccleſiaſtical, about Church power, meetings and maters.2. There are two Kinds of Cauſes, of thoſe they call Eccleſiaſtical; ſome that are only extrinſically ſuch, but in their nature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat ends and uſe; civil, that, for their more remote ends and reſpects to things truely and properly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, are called Eccleſiaſtical, as lawes made for the Church &amp; her concerns, outward liberty and peace, external rewards and punishments, &amp;c. Againe ſome cauſes Eccleſiaſtical are intrinſically and formally ſuch, as who shall preach the Goſpel, &amp; be inveſted with the Miniſtery, or who shall be depoſed from it, who shall be rebuked, admonished and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; or received and admitted into the Church, &amp;c.3. The terme <hi>CAUSES</hi> is not here to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a phyſical, but moral and juridical ſenſe; that is, for queſtions to be decided by thoſe, who are impowered, either by God or men, to this work.4. Cauſes or queſtions, as they are the object of power &amp; its exerciſe, are either proper and immediat; or els improper and remote. Hence we ſay.
1. That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat is Supream Governour in all things or cauſes, properly civil, relating to cauſes and perſons Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical: the judicial cognition and definitive judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe belong to him, and not to the Church: in this ſenſe we admit the oath of Supremacy, &amp; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ourſelves willing to take it, which was refuſed us.2. That the Magiſtrat is not the ſupreme Governour in Cauſes, and over perſons formally Eccleſiaſtical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This we aſſert belongs to Chriſt Jeſus only, and not to the Magiſtrat, as hath been proven above. This is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:39286:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſupremacy, we deny to the Magiſtrat, and for which we have declined to take the oath anent it, that is now eſtablished law, being perſwaded (for the reaſons formerly given) that this is the ſupremacy granted by law; and underſtood in this oath. But3. That cauſes and perſons formally Eccleſiaſtical, are not the proper and immediat object of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats power, but only improper and remote, and the reaſon is, becaus in the execution of Chriſts law given to the Church, the judicial cognition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive judgment about theſe belongs not to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat, but to the Miniſters of the word; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is not the Magiſtrats part to cognoſce and determine, who is to be received into the Church, and who not; this is proper to the Miniſters of the Goſpel: and ſo of other cauſes and queſtions of the like nature. <hi>Obj.</hi> Then the Magiſtrat, in protecting, countenancing and furthering of the Churches acts and ſentences by the ſword, muſt be a blinde execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them! <hi>Anſ.</hi> This muſt be ſaid out of envy and malice; for
(1.) the Church is the executer of her own acts and ſentences, and not the Magiſtrat, who only puts to execution his owne lawes, that he is pleaſed to enact on her behalf.(2.) It is known to all, that we grant to the Magiſtrat, (and to all in the Church,) a diſcretive judgment to cognoſce on the Churches acts and ſentences; and if he finde them not to be juſt, he hath a definitive judgment, anent the execution of his own Lawes made about them: for the obligation that ariſes from Churches acts and ſentences on all in the Church, to the obeying and furthering of them, is only conditional, and not abſolute; that is, none is bound to obey and advance
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:39286:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Churches ſentences, except their mater be juſt and righteous, which muſt be firſt known before they finde themſelves obliged to this. But here the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat object of the Magiſtrats power and its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, about Church acts and ſentences, is properly civil, and not Eccleſiaſtical, to wit, whether he will execute his owne law or not. Theſe things are eaſy and plaine, and if ambition and worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts had not determined many to the contrare, there would be little controverſie about them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj:</hi> 8. The Magiſtrats power and its exerciſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Church maters and meetings, being indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the Church; what he does in relation to Church concerns, determinations and ſentences, he may doe it antecedent to theſe, without the Church. <hi>Anſ.</hi> We deny the conſequence to be univerſally true: for ſome of the Magiſtrats ſentences about Church maters and meetings doe neceſſarly ſuppone, the Churches ſentences and acts, for their object; as theſe of ordination, excommunication: acts of regulation &amp;c. muſt neceſſarly paſs, before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat can reach the perſons and things, to which they are applyed: for inſtance, before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat can doe juſtice to a Miniſter in his maintenance, he muſt firſt be ordained, &amp; by it have right thereto, on the Churches act of ordination; which muſt firſt be known to the Magiſtrat, and by him given as the ground or reaſon of his ſentence, for the Miniſters legal right to enjoy and uſe the provided and allowed maintenance; and ſo of many others. We grant, in ſome caſes and things, a power to the Magiſtrat about Church maters and meetings, which he may exerciſe, antecedent to the exerciſe of Church power;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:39286:103"/>he may, yea, no doubt, he ought to command Miniſters when negligent, to their work or duty, without a Church ſentence, yea contrare to it: but to ſay, that the exerciſe of his power, in many things and caſes, is not neceſſarly ſubſequent to the acts and exerciſe of Church power, is moſt abſurd, &amp; abhorrent to all right reaſon; ſeing there are many things that the Magiſtrat ought to doe to and for the Church, that neceſſarly ſuppone, not only the being, but the exerciſe of Church power, without which the Magiſtrat cannot doe: how shall he punish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious, heretical and excommunicat perſones till they be firſt dealt with by the Church, conforme to the rules of the word, and declared to be ſuch, &amp;c. The reaſon of the conſequence is weak; for all created power ſuppones its object, and in its exerciſe muſt be ſubſequent and poſteriour to it; which is not inconſiſtent with the independency of any power on another; as is to be ſeen in the inſtance of the marital power, and others; the power of the Magiſtrat about it preſupponeth the conjugal relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; its acts, before it can put the laws in execution, anent it, in application to the perſones under that relation. The deſigne of this objection is obvious, which is, to evert all Church Government, the neceſſity and uſe of it: but before it have its full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended force, it muſt firſt be proven, that Church power and its acts are competent to the Magiſtrat, and may be done by him; as that he may ordaine, depoſe, receive into, and caſt out of the Church, preach the word, diſpenſe all ordinances, &amp;c. which no <hi>Eraſtian</hi> hath yet done; for if theſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent to the Magiſtrat, and are to be done by others, the former concluſion will hold.</p>

The iſſue of our adverſaries arguments, in the defence of the <hi>Antitheſes,</hi> reſolving in theſe three, the imperfection of the Scriptures; the manifeſt and violent perverting and wreſting of them; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and open contradicting of their authority, by <hi>Hobs Leviathan,</hi> and others more groſs, (if groſſer can be) do ſufficiently declare, what the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the contrare opinion is, and what we may
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39286:104"/>expect, will be the reſult of the ſame, if things continue, for ſometime, in their preſent channel. All Proteſtants, before theſe debats entered on the field, eſteemed the perfection of the Scriptures, the chief and principal foundation of the reformed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion; and builded thereon their doctrins, in oppoſition to popery: which, the patrones of prelacy doe now ſtrick at, and labour to shake, in denying their ſufficiency or perfection, in maters of obedience or practice; whereby they break the force of all the arguments, that the Proteſtants uſed againſt the Papiſts, for the fulneſs and perfection of the holy Scriptures: and the truth is, prelacy cannot be mainta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined without this aſſertion; as is to be ſeen in the moſt eminent aſſertors of it: for if we hold the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be a perfect and full rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and not to be receded from, in maters of doctrine, worship and Government; the prelacy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, having ſo little evidence from them, it cannot ſtand, and if this ſufficient regulation of the Scripturs be refuſed, what a wide door is opened to humane inventions; and what may not men bring in at it, to the corrupting and polluting of all the Churches concerns? We grant, the admitting of the Scriptures, for a pairt of the Churches Canon and rule, ſeems to draw a barr on much of the Romish trash, (which is condemned thereby;) but does not the prelates boldneſs, in violenting and forceing of them, in anſwering of our arguments, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their concepts, remove this barr, and lay the door open, for what they will for howbeit the Scripture ſpeaks, againſt the worshiping of Creatures, Images, Angels and Men, and chargeth theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39286:104"/>with idolatry: yet <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and moſt of the now prelatical gang, purge the popish maſſe, the worshiping of the hoſt, of the virgine Mary, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges &amp; Saints, from idolatry and ſuperſtition. How impudently bold are the <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> in wreſting the Scriptures, uſed by their antagoniſts; in which they are not inferior to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the moſt noted hereticks of the Church; but we muſt ſay, with leſſe shew of reaſon; as will be evident to any, that will compare them together in their comments. What ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can the Church promiſe her ſelf from theſe mens principles and wayes, who build their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, on ſuch foundations, which if once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted overturns all? But alas! when to enlarge the Magiſtrats power, and to give ſupport to their wild aſſertions about it, the divine authority and doctrins of the Holy Scriptures are boldly contradicted; and all Religion ultimatly reſolved into the Magiſtrats Conſcience and Lawes; as <hi>Hobs Leviathan, Parker</hi> &amp; others, undertake to make out, againſt the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; ſuperſtructu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
